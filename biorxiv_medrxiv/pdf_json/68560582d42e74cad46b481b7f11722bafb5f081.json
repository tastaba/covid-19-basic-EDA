To validate and demonstrate : bioRxiv preprint the utility of ISM-based subtyping: (1) We show the distinct genetic subtypes of European infections, in which early on infections are related to the viral subtypes that has become dominant in Italy followed by the development of local subtypes, (2) We distinguish subtypes associated with outbreaks in distinct parts of the United States, identify the development of a local subtype potentially due to community to transmission and distinguish it from the predominant subtype in New York, suggesting that the outbreak in New York is linked to imported cases from Europe. (3) We present results that quantitatively show the temporal behavior of the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 from localization in China to a pattern of distinct regional subtypes as the virus spreads throughout the world over time. Accordingly, we show that genetic subtyping using entropy-based ISMs can play an important complementary role to phylogenetic tree-based analysis, such as the Nextstrain [10] project, in efficiently quantifying SARS-CoV-2 dynamics to enable modeling, data-mining, and machine learning tools. Following from this initial study, we have developed a pipeline to dynamically generate ISMs for newly added SARS-CoV-2 sequences and generate updated visualization of geographical and temporal dynamics, and made it available on Github at https://github.com/EESI/ISM. 2",

In particular, to 62 satisfy the latter need, we propose compressing the full viral genome to generate a small number of 63 nucleotides that are highly informative of the way in which the viral genome dynamically changes. Based on 64 such a signature, SARS-CoV-2 subtypes may thus be defined and then quantitatively characterized in terms 65 of their geographic abundance, as well as their abundance in time -and, potentially also detect clinical 66 variation in disease progression associated with viral subtypes. We propose and develop a pipeline to utilize 67 entropy to identify highly informative nucleotide positions, and, in turn, identifying characteristic 68 Informative Subtype Markers (ISM) that can be used to subtype individual SARS-CoV-2 virus genomes. We 69 evaluate the pipeline by demonstrating the potential of ISMs to model and visualize the geographic and 70 temporal patterns of the SARS-CoV-2 using sequences that are currently publicly available from the GISAID 71 database.

We also included a reference sequence from National Center for Biotechnology Information 2 80 (NCBI Accession number: NC 045512.2). This resulted in an overall data set of 3982 sequences with 81 sequence length ranging from 25342 nt to 30355 nt. We then align all remaining sequences after filtering 82 together using MAFFT [14] using the \"FFT-NS-2\" method in XSEDE [32] . After alignment, the sequence 83 length is extended (for the present data set, up to 35362 nt). For the aligned sequences, we merged the sequence with the metadata in Nextstrain project 3 as it is in April 6, 2020 based on identification number, gisaid epi isl, provided by GISAID [26] . We further filtered out sequences with incomplete date information in metadata (e.g, \"2020-01\"), so that our analysis can also incorporate temporal information with daily resolution, given the fast-moving nature of the pandemic. In addition, we filtered out sequences from unknown host or non-human hosts. The resultant final dataset contains 3832 sequences excluding the reference sequence. Then, we calculate the entropy by:",

We estimated 86 p k from the frequency of characters. We refer to characters in the preceding because, in addition to the bases 87 a, c, g, and t, the sequences include additional characters representing gaps and ambiguities: -, b, d, h, k, m, 88 n, r, s, v, w, and y. (Note that the sequences are of cDNA derived from viral RNA, so there is a t 89 substituting for the u that would appear in the viral RNA sequence.) However, sites n and -(representing an 90 ambiguous site and a gap respectively) are less informative. Therefore, we further define a masked entropy as 91 entropy calculated without considering sequences containing n andin a given nucleotide position in the 92 genome. Based on the entropy calculation, we developed a masked entropy calculation whereby we ignore the 93 n and -. With the help of this masked entropy calculation, we can focus on truly informative positions, 94 instead of positions at the start and end of the sequence in which there is substantial uncertainty due to 95 artifacts in the sequencing process. Finally, high entropy positions are selected by two criteria: 1) entropy 96 \u0105 0.5, and 2) the percentage of n andis less than 25%. This yielded 17 distinct positions along the viral 97 genome sequence. We then extract Informative Subtype Markers (ISMs) at these 17 nucleotide positions 98 from each sequence. Figure 1 shows how we identified these two criteria. The left hand side of the plot shows 99 that there is a peak with entropy greater than 0.5, which we sought to retain. Looking to the right hand side 100 of the plot, setting threshold to 0.25 will keep the peak on the left which represents the most informative 101 group of sites in the genome.",

[38] A study has also shown that, like the spike protein, the internal 160 nucleoprotein of the virus is significant in modulating the antibody response. [31] 161 Additionally, Table 1 shows a high-entropy, informative site in the predicted coding region ORF8. Based 162 on structural homology analysis the ORF8 region in SARS-CoV-2 does not have a known functional domain 163 or motif [4] . In previously characterized human SARS coronavirus, ORF8 has been associated with an 164 enhanced inflammatory response, but that sequence feature does not appear to have been conserved in 165 SARS-CoV-2, and, in general, SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 appears divergent from other previously characterized 166 SARS-related coronaviruses [4, 39] . Previous entropy-based analysis of earlier and smaller SARS-CoV-2 167 sequence data sets have suggested that there is a mutational hotspot in ORF8, including early divergence 168 between sequences found in China, and large scale deletions found in patients in Singapore -which is 169 consistent with the results we have found here on a much more comprehensive analysis of genomes [3, 27, 29] . 170 Similarly, sites were identified in the ORF3a reading frame, which also appears to have diverged 171 substantially from other SARS-related viruses. In particular, the SARS-CoV-2 variant in the predicted 172 ORF3 region appear also to not contain functional domains that were responsible for increased inflammatory 173 response as they were in those viruses [4, 39] .",

In those cases, it appears from Figures 8, 11 , and 12 that in later times, other 371 subtypes have emerged over time and are becoming increasingly abundant. One potential explanation is that 372 because the SARS-CoV-2, is an RNA virus and thus highly susceptible to mutation as transmissions 373 occur [19] . Therefore, as transmissions have continued, the ISM associated with the reference sequence has 374 been replaced by different ISMs due to these mutations. Another plausible explanation for such leveling off 375 in a region is that the leveling off in relative abundance of the subtype represents containment of that 376 subtype's transmission while other subtypes continue to expand in that country or region. The latter could 377 plausibly explain the pattern observed in the United States, where earlier subtypes connected to Asia did not 378 increase in abundance while a putative endogenous subtype, as well as the dominant New York subtype, have 379 significantly increased in abundance (see Figure 8 and accompanying discussion above). Further investigation 380 and modeling of subtype distributions, as well as additional data, will be necessary to help resolve these All the inferences from the temporal trends in subtypes described in the foregoing, however, must be 383 limited by important caveats: Because the number of viral sequences is much smaller than the number of 384 cases, there may be a lag before a sample is sequenced that includes a particular ISM. As a result, even 385 though subtype CCCTGCCTGTAGGCGGG is first seen in the United States on February 20, 2020 and then a 386 sequence with that ISM was obtained in Canada sequences about 14 days later, that does not necessarily 387 mean that Canada acquired this subtype from the United States. While the presence or absence of this 388 subtype in sequences obtained from travelers may shed light on this question, it cannot be definitive because 389 so few cases due to travel have been sequenced. However, given the amount of time that has lapsed, the 390 general result that this subtype did not originate in Mainland China, for example, is more robust.",

As an extreme case, Iceland, which has a 393 small population, represents nearly 9% of all sequences in the complete data set. Italy, on the other hand, 394 had a large and early outbreak but has disproportionately less sequencing coverage. As a result, tracking the 395 relative abundances of subtypes across different regions is complicated, because a region that does more 396 sequencing may simply end up having a greater number of sequences of any given subtype. This problem is 397 exacerbated in temporal analysis, because the extent of sequencing efforts in a region may also change over 398 time. Some ISMs also include gaps and ambiguity, which indicate the presence of noise in some sequence 399 data. For example, subtype TCTCGTCCACGGGNNNN could in fact be subtype TCTCGTCCACGGGTAAC and subtype 400 TCTCGTCCACGGGTGGG. We are currently developing methodologies to improve the precision of ISM definition 401 by accounting for technical sequencing errors and ambiguous base calls.

We then plotted the distance of each ISM along the dates of the first 417 sequence in which the ISM was first detected.

This provides additional confidence in the 420 robustness of subtyping by ISM according to sequence date. By way of further illustrating this point, Figure 421 15 superimposes the cumulative reported number of confirmed COVID-19 cases over time. 4 While these data 422 provide only a limted picture of the actual number of SARS-CoV-2 infections (including because of limited 423 testing), it further demonstrates that ISM subtypes following sequence dates are capable of tracking the 424 actual temporal progress of the virus.",

An important caveat of this approach, as with others based on analysis of viral genome 461 sequence, is that it is limited by the sampling of viral sequences. Small and non-uniform samples of 462 sequences may not accurately reflect the true diversity of viral subtypes within a given population. However, 463 the ISM-based approach has the advantage of being scalable as sequence information grows, and as a result 464 will be able to become both more accurate and precise as sequence information grows within different 465 geographical and other subpopulations. Indeed, with the pipeline in place and access to continuously 466 updating sequencing data, ISMs may be continuously identified as new sequences are sequenced and 467 categorized to a subtype for further analysis. In the future, therefore, as data becomes available, ISM-based 468 subtyping may be employed on subpopulations within regions, demographic groups, and groups of patients 469 with different clinical outcome. Efficient subtyping of the massive amount of SARS-CoV-2 sequence data will 470 therefore enable quantitative modeling and machine learning methods to develop improved containment and 471 potentially also therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2.

These subtypes are found in other countries/regions, but in distinct patterns, which may likely 190 correspond to different patterns of transmission of the virus. For example, sequences in Japan are dominated 191 by CCCCTCCCACAGGTGGG, the third of the subtypes listed for Mainland China, and first observed in a sequence in Japan on February 10, 2020. However, this subtype is not prevalent in other countries/regions, 193 with limited abundance in Australia, Canada, and Singapore -countries that are likely to have travel links 194 to both Mainland China and Japan. However, in Singapore a major subtype is CCCTGCCCACAGG-GGG , which 195 is very close to subtype which was found in Mainland China (CCCCTCCCACAGGTGGG).Moreover, additional metadata provided for certain sequences for the country of exposure in cases197    involving travelers reveals that in other non-Asian countries, the CCCCTCCCACAGGTGGG subtype was frequently 198 found in travelers from Iran, including multiple sequences from Canada and Australia, as well as sequences 199 from the United States (specifically New York), New Zealand, and France. Given that the subtype was otherwise not abundant in these countries, it suggests that these traces are due to the subtype being 201 prevalent in Iran at the time these travel cases were found. But in the absence of sequence data from Iran, it 202 is not presently possible to confirm that hypothesis. In any event, the analysis shows that the ISM-based subtype patterns in Asian countries/regions are related or shared, though as can be seen, the larger portion 204 of outbreaks Singapore and Japan appear to have drawn from distinct subtypes that were found earlier in Mainland China, potentially leading to the hypothesis that there were multiple distinct travel-related transmissions from China (or potentially from Iran) to both countries by the time of this analysis.The data further indicate that the United States has a distinct pattern of dominant subtypes. In particular the subtype with the highest relative abundance among U.S. sequences is CCCTGCCTGTAGGCGGG, first seen in February 20, 2020. This subtype has also emerged as a major subtype in Canada, with the first 210 sequence being found on March 5, 2020.
