To our knowledge, present study, a multicenter retrospective cohort study, is the first clinical research on the efficiency of IVIG treatment on critical COVID-19 patients and with the largest number of cases. Patients received IVIG were in more severe condition. However, for the critical COVID-19 patients, the results showed that IVIG has no effect on the 28-day mortality and 60day mortality. Notably, multivariable regression showed that both classification of COVID-19 and IVIG using were the factors which related with hazards ratios of death. Subgroup analysis showed that only in patients with critical type, IVIG could significantly reduce the 28-day mortality rate and prolong the survival time, decrease the inflammatory response and improve some organ functions (all P< 0.05), and IVIG had a more significantly curative effect by using IVIG in the early stage (admission\u2264 7 days) and with high dose (>15 g/d).

In addition, immunoglobulin showed antiviral and anti-inflammatory effect by increasing some cytokines secretion, such as IL-2, promoting T cell and B cell proliferation and differentiation. Therefore, immunoglobulin has been widely used in virus infectious diseases and autoimmune disease treatment, especially in viral pneumonia [12, 13] . Previous studies in SARS and MERS therapy also suggested that high dose immunoglobulin could be beneficial [16, 17] . Since immunoglobulin was not the specific antibody to any virus and its clinical evidence was limited, some researchers held the oppose view about immunoglobulin effect on acute virus infection [18, 19] . In both China and WHO COVID-19 treatment guidance, the recommendation on immunoglobulin usage was optional.",

Univariate survival analysis showed that APACHE II and SOFA sore were the risk factor which related with the outcome. In further analysis, we found APACHE II and SOFA score were relatively low in most our enrolled patients. This is consisted with the characteristic of this disease, that is, only severe lung injury, with few other organ damage. COX regression confirmed that critical type in COVID-19 patients showed poor prognosis and IVIG rescued these patients. Though IVIG has no effect on the whole patients, it could be beneficial to the critical type patients. In addition, COX regression also founded that lymphopenia was the risk of poor prognosis. Previous study reported that 35%-83% COVID-19 patients showed lymphocyte count decreased, and persistent lymphopenia was related with the poor outcome [25], consist with our results. However, subgroup analysis according to the lymphocyte counts did not show that IVIG could improve the patient outcome.",

To further confirm the effects of dose of IVIG on the outcomes of COVID-19 patients, subgroup with different doses of IVIG (>15 g/d and \u226415 g/d) were compared, and we found that high dose IVIG (>15 g/d) could significantly reduce 28-day and 60-day mortality (p= 0.044, 0.049, respectively, table 5), and increase survival time (p= 0.045, supplementary figure 4) than that with\u2264 15 g/d IVIG treatment. Deeply comparison between the subgroups with different COVID-19 types, the results showed that high dose IVIG of more than 15 g/d could significantly reduce the 28-day and 60-day mortality of patients in critical type (p = 0.002, P < 0.0001, perspective, table 6), and increase the survival time (P < 0.0001, supplementary Figure 5). But for patients in severe type, no therapeutic effect was observed whatever the different doses of IVIG (Table 6, supplementary Figure 6). By comparing the effects of different doses on the parameters of inflammatory response and organ functions, the results showed that high doses of IVIG (\uff1e15g/d) could significantly decrease the lactic level and increase Pa0 2 /FiO 2 (both p < 0.05, supplementary table 5), especially in patients of critical type (supplementary table 6).",
