There are no registered effective medicines, treatment options are 70 mainly supportive, and there are no vaccines available, limiting preventive measures mainly 71 to social distancing combined with isolation of infected persons and those that have high 72 likelihood of being infected, for instance because they have been traced as contacts of 73 infected persons [1, 2] . However, recently it was questioned by high-ranked officials of the 74 World Health Organization (WHO) whether social distancing or lockdowns are sufficient to 75 stop the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus- 76 who-ryan/lockdowns-not-enough-to-defeat-coronavirus-whos-ryan-idUSKBN2190FM). To what extent local containment or local slowing down of an epidemic by isolation and 84 contact tracing is successful depends on the fraction of infections that remain asymptomatic 85 or have mild disease, and on the infectiousness before the onset of symptoms [4, 5] . It is 86 known that a high probability of asymptomatic infection, a high proportion of transmission 87 occurring before the onset of symptoms, a long delay between case finding and isolation, 88 and high overall transmissibility all factor in negatively in the likelihood that an outbreak can 89 6 be contained [6] [7] [8] [9] . For SARS-CoV-2, evidence indicates that a high fraction of infected 90 persons is infectious before they show symptoms (up to 50%), that a substantial fraction of 91 infections may be asymptomatic or show only mild symptoms (up to 80%), and that the We focus on conditions that make containment of an early epidemic possible, but also on 106 the impact of isolation and contact tracing when containment is not possible, or in an exit 107 phase from social distancing. In a population with social distancing in place, we investigate 108 what the additional impact of isolation and contact tracing can be for reaching containment 109 or slowing down the spread. We report effective reproduction number, the (exponential) 110 rate of increase, and the doubling time of the epidemic for scenarios with various 111 combinations of interventions.

As it is likely that, on the 114 one hand, isolation and contact tracing will be more effective in close contact settings with 115 well-defined contacts (household, workplace) than in the community (commuting, public CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. Table 1) . We distinguish 131 between household contacts and non-household contacts, which differ in the risk of 132 infection and the delay and effectiveness of tracing and isolation. Intervention effectiveness 133 is determined by the daily probability of being diagnosed during the infectious period (Table   134 2). Furthermore, intervention effectiveness depends on the delays in tracing household and 135 non-household contacts, respectively, and the proportions of contacts can be found and 136 isolated. We assume that isolation is perfect, i.e. that isolated persons cannot transmit any Natural history 142 We assume that the latent period lasts between 4 and 6 days. Individuals then become 143 infectious for at most 10 days. Infectivity is high at the beginning of the infectious period 144 and decays to low levels during these 10 days ( Figure S1a ). The probability of symptoms 145 onset increases during the first 4 days of the infectious period, thereby influencing the daily 146 probability of diagnosis during the infectious period (see below). 147 An infectious individual makes contacts with household members and persons outside the 148 household. We model the daily number of household contacts with a Poisson distribution, 149 and the numbers of non-household contacts with a negative binomial distribution (Table 1) , 150 with parameters based on the average household size in the Netherlands, and numbers of 151 contacts observed in a contact study in the Netherlands (FigureS1b) [20] . With the chosen 152 parameters, the mean number of contacts per day is 13.2 (SD 8.5). 153 On each day of the infectious period, an individual makes a number of contacts according to 154 the contact distribution. This number is reduced by a factor describing the probability that 155 the contact person has already been infected during earlier contacts with the index person. 156 More precisely, the number of contacts is reduced by a factor fk per day k of the infectious 157 period, describing the probability that a contact has already been infected on previous days 158 of the infectious period of the index case. The probability of transmission upon contact with 159 a susceptible household contact is given by the distribution in Figure S1a . As contacts with 160 persons outside the household are often less close, we assume that the transmission 161 probability for these contacts is lower by factor 0.25.

We assume that when a case is diagnosed, 202 he/she will immediately be isolated and this will stop onward transmission completely. 203 Furthermore, we assume that all contacts will be traced, and if found infected will be 204 isolated immediately. We assume that it takes 1 day to find and isolate both household and 205 non-household contacts. The rationale for using these overly optimistic assumptions as a 206 baseline is that we want to investigate the maximum contribution contact tracing can 207 provide for achieving containment. In sensitivity analyses we investigated for various control 208 parameters at which point of diverging from the baseline parameters control of the 209 outbreak will be lost (Supplementary Information).",

We use a stochastic transmission model in which every person 23 generates novel infections according to a probability distribution that is affected by the 24 incubation period distribution (time from infection to symptoms), distribution of the latent 25 period (time from infection to onset of infectiousness), and overall transmissibility. The 26 model distinguishes between close contacts (e.g., within a household) and other contacts in 27 the population. Social distancing affects the number of contacts outside but not within The proportion of asymptomatic or unascertained cases has a strong impact on the 30 controllability of the disease. If the proportion of asymptomatic infections is larger than 31 30%, contact tracing and isolation cannot achieve containment for an R0 of 2.5. Achieving 32 containment by social distancing requires a reduction of numbers of non-household 33 contacts by around 90%. Depending on the realized level of contact reduction, tracing and 34 isolation of only household contacts, or of household and non-household contacts are 35 necessary to reduce the effective reproduction number to below 1. A combination of has caused over 850,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19. In the absence of 49 effective medicines and vaccines, the preventive measures are limited to social distancing, 50 isolation of confirmed and suspected cases and identification of their contacts. Using a 51 transmission model, we evaluated the impact of social distancing, isolation and contact 52 tracing on slowing down or even containing COVID-19 epidemics. We investigated how 53 various combinations of social distancing, isolation, and contact tracing reduce the effective 54 reproduction number, and what is needed to achieve the critical threshold of a reproduction 55 number below 1. We estimated the impact of combinations of measures on epidemic 56 growth rate and doubling time for the number of infections. We find that under realistic 57 assumptions on the level of social distancing, additional isolation and contact tracing are 58 needed for stopping the epidemic. Whether quarantining only household contacts is 59 sufficient, depends on levels of social distancing and timeliness of tracing and isolation. Our 60 analyses, based on best understanding of the epidemiology of COVID-19, highlight that even 61 if social distancing is in place, isolation and contact tracing at least of household contacts are 62 needed to stop the epidemic, and these additional measures help to delay and lower the 63 epidemic peak. Therefore, isolation and contact tracing will be important tools for enabling 64 exiting of currently implemented social distancing measures. Introduction 67",

R0 is defined as the number of secondary cases an 223 index case generates on average in a susceptible population, and Re is the number of 224 secondary infections per case when an intervention is in place. R0 is determined by daily 225 transmission probabilities and numbers of contacts. The effective reproduction number is in 226 addition determined by the level of social distancing, diagnosis probabilities, tracing delays, 227 and tracing coverages per day of the infectious period. We can therefore investigate how Re 228 depends on R0 and on the intervention parameters. 229 We are interested in the critical tracing coverage, i.e. what proportion of non-household 230 contacts needs to be found and isolated to control the outbreak, for populations with 231 various levels of social distancing. Furthermore, we study the epidemic growth rate (or 232 epidemic doubling time) without and with contact tracing and isolation and various levels of 233 social distancing.

In our247    analysis for different levels of social distancing we assumed that 60% of infected of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data 252 interpretation, writing of the manuscript, or the decision to submit for publication. All 253 authors had full access to all the data in the study and were responsible for the decision baseline scenario without interventions we calibrate the transmission probability such 260 that the basic reproduction number equals R0 = 2.5. In that case, 39% of transmissions prevented, the outbreak would be just under the control limit. In the baseline 264 scenario without interventions the exponential growth rate is 0.19 per day and the doubling265 time is 3.6 days, which agrees with published estimates [13]. For sensitivity analysis of the 266 relation between R0 and Re for various combinations of parameters, diagnosed cases alone reduces the doubling time to almost 4 days. If social 270 distancing is implemented 28 days after the first case was diagnosed, and the number of 271 non-household contacts is reduced by 70% [21], the doubling time will increase to around 14 272 days (Figure 1a). The figure also shows that it takes a week before the impact on the 273 epidemic growth starts to be visible. If higher levels of social distancing can be achieved, the 274 doubling times can be increased more (Figure 1b), but even for 90% reduction of contacts 275 the curve has not been flattened. In Figure 1c the impact of the timing of social distancing 276 measures on the further course of the outbreak is shown. The figure demonstrates how 277 every week delay in implementing these measures leads to an order of magnitude higher 278 numbers of cases, thus emphasizing the importance of fast implementation of social 279 distancing measures. Finally, in Figure 4d we show a scenario where social distancing is 280 implemented at day 28 after diagnosing the first case and reduces non-household contacts 281 by 70%. Then at day 49, also contact tracing is implemented.

In practice, however, the potential for containment will be seriously jeopardized 336 by various delays and imperfections in the tracing process. Especially delays in diagnosis and 337 isolation, and the existence of asymptomatic and mild infections that contribute to onward 338 transmission will make an outbreak uncontrollable. As evidence is mounting that the 339 proportion of asymptomatic and mild cases is large and leads to substantial numbers of340 unascertained cases [22], most countries have now switched to strategies of social 341 distancing or complete lockdowns. Such measures have proven effective earlier during the 342 2009 influenza pandemic [23, 24]. However, social distancing can never be complete, as 343 healthcare workers and doctors have to continue their work, but also personnel of 344 supermarkets, public transport employees, and others need to have contact outside their 345 households. Therefore, transmission chains may remain.

Our analyses show that isolation 369 and contact tracing when combined with social distancing can contribute to reducing the 370 growth rate and increasing the doubling time of epidemics, thereby buying time, spreading 371 the number of severe cases out over a longer period of time, and potentially also reducing 372 the total number of infections (the \"final size\") [26].

Household contacts are at a higher risk of becoming infected than non-379 household contacts as persons in a household will usually have repeated contacts. On the 380 other hand, our analyses show that household infections contribute less to onward 381 transmission than non-household infections simply because the numbers of household 382 contacts are much lower than numbers of other contacts. As a consequence, the 383 effectiveness in isolating non-household contacts is key for a successful of the model is that quantitative information about distributions of the latent and 387 infectious periods, and the infectivity per day of the infectious period can be incorporated 388 easily and detailed, such that if new and better data on those quantities emerge, the 389 analysis can be updated quickly.
