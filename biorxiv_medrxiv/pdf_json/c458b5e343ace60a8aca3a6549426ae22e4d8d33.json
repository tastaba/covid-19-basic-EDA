Screening methods are unable to identify all cases, due to limitations in the sensitivity and specificity. Exposed travellers can complete a journey during the incubation period when they are undetectable, and some exposed travellers may never show symptoms at all [10, 11] . Furthermore, when applied early in an epidemic, screening methods that rely on detecting fever will identify many more cases of other respiratory diseases such as influenza than the target disease. While travel restrictions are highly unlikely to prevent the ultimate importation of COVID-19 [12] , they can reasonably be anticipated to delay the establishment of an epidemic in a country, buying valuable time for health authorities to establish response measures.",

The expected numbers of imported cases in each intermediary country was estimated using an approach proposed by De Salazar and colleagues (2020) based on air travel volume estimates from China since COVID-19 emergence [12] . Their model estimates the expected number of imported cases in countries by regressing the number of imported cases reported by each country against their relative incoming travel volumes from China (under unrestricted travel). They assume that the expected case count would be linearly proportional to air travel volume. Bootstrap sampling was used to estimate 95% confidence intervals. We fitted the model to reported cumulative case counts for each country extracted from WHO situation reports 2, 9, 16, 23, and 30 (i.e., one per week from January 22).",

The potential number of undetected imported cases (as of February 19, 2020) in each country of the South East Asia and Western Pacific regions (intermediary countries) is displayed in Figure 3 . Projected epidemic curves for selected countries are shown in Figure 4 (curves for all countries considered are provided in the Appendix), with reported imported and local cases also shown for context. All four countries shown have high levels of expected imported cases ( Figure  2 ). Thailand and Indonesia have fewer reported cases than expected, and hence a higher estimated number of undetected cases (Figure 3 ), leading to projection of considerable undetected local transmission. In contrast, Malaysia and Singapore both reported a number of cases equal to or greater than expected, and hence have a lower estimated number of undetected cases, leading to projection of more modest levels of local transmission. Note that the projected levels of transmission in Singapore are lower than the actual reported cases. These known local cases were not further incorporated into our analysis, but rather signalled to decision makers that the likelihood of further undetected transmission was relatively low.",

Briefly, their model estimates the expected number of imported cases in countries by regressing the number of imported cases reported by each country against their estimated incoming travel volumes from China.
