Edeficient SARS-CoV is also attenuated in vivo, exhibiting diminished pathogenic effects (15, 16) and inability to grow in the central nervous system (17) , suggesting that CoV E may act as an important virulence factor in coronaviruses. The C-terminal region of SARS-CoV E is mostly \u03b1-helical (9) and harbors at its extremity a so-called (PSD95/DLG1/ZO-1) PDZ-binding motif (PBM) (18) that was identified as a critical virulence determinant (19) . PDZ are common globular domains that interact with short linear motifs (SLiMs) usually present at the C-terminus of their target proteins and prevalent within intrinsically disordered regions (20) . Through its C-terminal PBM, SARS-CoV E was shown to engage into interactions with multiple host proteins such as syntenin (19) and PALS1 (18) .

These substitutions were mapped onto the SARS-CoV-2 E structural model (Fig. 5B) . We found that the mutated residues tend to locate on the surface of the protein, in line with previous observations that the hydrophobic core of proteins from RNA viruses shows greater conservation than functional sites on the protein surface (32, 33) . Interestingly, we also detected a partial deletion spanning eight amino acids (including a Cys residue) in a turn present upstream of the BH3-like region. In addition to shortening the transmembrane domain, which may affect subcellular localization (e.g. by enhancing retention in the Golgi (34)), such deletion might interfere with the binding properties of the SARS-CoV-2 E BH3-like motif by introducing local conformational rearrangements.",

Because many viruses have evolved strategies to interfere with apoptosis, research is needed to establish if the E protein from SARS-CoV-2 directly or indirectly targets prosurvival Bcl-2 homologs (beyond Bcl-xL) to modulate cell viability. Contradictory results have been published regarding CoV E ability to induce or repress apoptosis. Overexpressed epitope-tagged SARS-CoV E was found to promote apoptotic cell death in the Jurkat cell line (21) , and 17Cl-1 cells infected with the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (murine coronavirus) exhibited a higher level of apoptosis (36) . In contrast, cells infected by a coronavirus lacking E (SARS-CoV\u0394E) were more primed for apoptosis than those infected with the wt strain (16) . This latter study also suggested that CoV E may have an anti-apoptotic function by suppressing the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), likely as a survival mechanism important for virus dissemination. It may well be that CoV E activity could protect cells from cell death at early stages post-infection (by regulating the UPR) and induce apoptosis at a later stage (via Bcl-xL sequestration at the Golgi (21) or through its author/funder.

The Pro residue at position 4 of the consensus (position 54 in the actual sequence) is totally conserved and a study indicated that it is critical for targeting the protein to the Golgi (30). The influence of the other residues present in the CoV E BH3-like motifs (including the potentially important Asn48 residue located three residues upstream of L51) on protein stability, subcellular targeting, function and interaction is unknown and awaits further characterization. To predict structure-activity relationship, we constructed a structural model of SARS-CoV-2 E guided by the homologous structure of SARS-CoV E (PDB code: 5X29) (9). Note that only four positions are different between full-length SARS-CoV E and SARS-CoV-2 E: two within the BH3-like helix (Thr55 and Val56 in SARS-CoV E, Ser55 and Phe56 in SARS-CoV-2) and two in a site immediately N-terminal to the PBM (where a pair of residues formed by Glu69 and Gly70 in SARS-CoV E is found instead of a single Arg69 residue in SARS-CoV-2 E).
