The emergence of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, that caused a viral pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei province, 5 China in early December 2019 has evolved into the COVID-19 acute respiratory disease pandemic due to its alarming levels of spread and severity, with a total of 1,249,107 confirmed infected cases, 256,059 recovered and 68,000 deaths in 183 countries as of April 3, 2020 ( [1, 2] ). The seemingly far from the epicenter, old continent became the second-most impacted region after Asia Pacific to Italy from Wuhan who was admitted to the hospital in Codogno, Lombardy on 20 February 21 was the first secondary infection case (\"patient 1\"). \"Patient 0\" was never identified by tracing the first Italian citizen's movements and contacts. In less than a week, the explosive increase in the number of cases in several bordering regions and autonomous provinces of northern Italy placed enormous strain on the decentralized health system. Following a dramatic spike in deaths from 25 COVID-19, Italy transformed into a \"red zone\", and the movement restrictions were expanded to the entire country on the 8th of March. All public gatherings were cancelled and school and university closures were extended through at least the next month.",

The first models mainly focused on the estimation of the basic reproduction number R 0 using dynamic mechanistic mathematical models ( [4, 5, 6, 7] ), but also simple exponential growth models (see e.g. [8, 9] ). Compartmental epidemiological models like SIR, SIRD, SEIR and SEIRD have been proposed to estimate other important epidemiological 40 parameters, such as the transmission rate and for forecasting purposes (see e.g. [7, 10] ). Other studies have used metapopulation models, which include data of human mobility between cities and/or regions to forecast the evolution of the outbreak in other regions/countries far from the original epicenter in China large percentage of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases experiencing the disease like the common cold or the flu (see e.g. [14] ), and (b) the uncertainty regarding the DAY-ZERO of the outbreak, the knowledge of which is crucial to assess the stage and dynamics of the epidemic, especially during the first growth period. 55 To cope with the above problems, we herein propose a SEIRD with two compartments, one modelling the total infected cases in the population and another modelling the confirmed cases. The proposed modelling approach is applied to Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, to estimate the scale of under-reporting of the number of actual cases in the total population, 60 the DAY-ZERO of the outbreak and for forecasting purposes. The above tasks were accomplished by the numerical solution of a mixed-integer optimization problem using the publicly available data of daily new cases for the period ",

Based on the above, and on the fact that within the subset of confirmed cases the mild cases are the 81% [15] , we have set the recovery period case-patient (infector) having symptoms and a secondary case-patient having again symptoms. In our model, the 1 \u03c3 = 3 period refers to the period from exposure to the onset of the contagiousness. In this period, obviously there 165 are no symptoms. Thus, the serial interval in our model is 7 days (this is the average number of days in which an infectious becomes recovered and no longer transmits the disease). Importantly, there are studies (see e.g. Nushiura et al. [20] ) suggesting that a substantial proportion of secondary transmission may occur prior to illness onset. Thus, the 7 days period that we have taken as the 170 average period that an infectious person can transmit the disease before he/she recovers, reflects exactly this period; it refers to the serial interval for the cases that are asymptomatic and for cases with mild symptoms.",

For example,295    it has been shown that social distancing and cautiousness reduce the disease transmission rate by about 20%[28].

It is well known that minor perturbations in the initial conditions of a complex system, such as the ones of an outbreak, may result in major changes in the observed dynamics. No doubt, a high level of uncertainty for DAY-ZERO, as well as the uncertainty in the 385 actual numbers of exposed people in the total population, raise several barriers to our ability to correctly assess the state and dynamics of the outbreak, and to forecast its evolution and its end. Such pieces of information would lower the barriers and help public health authorities respond fast and efficiently to the emergency.390 This study aimed exactly at shedding more light into this problem, taking advantage of state-of-the-art tools of mathematical modelling and numerical analysis/optimization tools. To achieve this goal, we addressed a compartmental SEIRD model with two infectious compartments in order to bridge the gap between the number of reported cases and the actual number of cases in the 395 total population. By following the proposed methodological framework, we found that the DAY-ZERO in Lombardy was around the mid of January, a date that precedes by one month the fate of the first confirmed case in the hardest-hit northern Italian region of Lombardy. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that the actual 400 cumulative number of infected cases in the total population in the period until March 8 was around 15 times the cumulative number of confirmed infected cases. Interestingly enough, regarding the estimation of the DAY-ZERO of the outbreak in Lombardy, a very recent study based on genomic and phylogenetic analyses reports the same time period, between the second half of January 405and early February, 2020, as the time when the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 entered northern Italy,[33].",
