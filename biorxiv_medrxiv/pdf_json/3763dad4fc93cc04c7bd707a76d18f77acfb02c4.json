With yet higher testing capacity, random testing further allows detection of geographical differences in spreading rates and thus the formulation of optimal strategies for a safe reboot of the economy.

III, we discuss the use of massive testing as a direct means to contain the pandemics, showing that it requires a 100-fold increase of the current testing frequency. In Sec. IV, we define the main challenge to be addressed: To measure the quantitative effect of restrictive measures on the transmission rate. Section V introduces the idea of randomized testing. Section VI constitutes the central part of this paper. It is shown how data from sparse sampling tests can be used to infer essentially instantaneous growth rates, and their regional dependence. We define a model of testing feed-back driven intervention strategy and analyze it theoretically. This model is also analyzed numerically in Sec. VII. Section VIII generalizes the modelling to a regionally refined analysis of the epidemic growth pattern which becomes the preferred choice if higher testing rates become available. We conclude with Sec. IX by summarizing our results and their implication for a safe reboot after the current lockdown. In the Appendix we address the use of contact tracing and argue that it can complement, but not substitute for random testing. The key quantity measured by random testing is the growth rate k of infection numbers. If k exceeds a tolerable upper threshold \u03ba + , restrictions are imposed. For k below a lower threshold \u03ba \u2212 , and if infection numbers are below critical, restrictions are released. In the absence of a substantial influx of infected people from outside the country, and provided infection numbers are below a critical value, the optimal target of the growth rate is k = 0, corresponding to a marginally stable state, where infections neither grow nor decrease exponentially with time. If higher testing rates are available, the measured observables and control strategies can be geographically refined.",

Can such a small number of detected infections be useful at all, given that these numbers fluctuate significantly from day to day? The answer is yes. We show that after a few days the acquired signal becomes stronger than the noise level. It is then possible to establish whether the infection number is growing or decreasing and, moreover, to obtain a quantitative estimate of the instantaneous growth rate k(t).",

A typical value when detecting large values of k 1 is C \u2248 30 \u2212 40. This result shows that the higher the number of tests r per day, the shorter the time to detect a growth or a decrease of the infected population. The smaller the Dynamics of the pandemic with and without a feedback and control scheme in place, as measured by the fraction i of infected people (logarithmic scale). After the limit of the health system, i c , has been reached, a lockdown brings i down again. The exponential rate of decrease is expected to be very slow, unless extreme measures are imposed. The release of measures upon a reboot is likely to re-induce exponential growth, but with a rate difficult to predict. Three possible outcomes are shown in blue curves in the scenario without testing feedback, where the effect of the new measures becomes visible only after a delay of 10-14 days. In the worst case, i grows by a multiplicative factor of order 20 before the growth is detected. A reboot can thus be risked only once i \u2264 i * * \u2261 i c /20, implying a very long time in lockdown after the initial peak. Due to the long delay until policy changes show observable effects, the fluctuations of i will be large. Random testing (the red curve) has a major advantage. It measures i instantaneously and detects its growth rate within few days, whereby the higher the testing rate the faster the detection. Policy adjustments can thus be made much faster, with smaller oscillations of i. A safe reboot is then possible much earlier, at the level of i \u2264 i * \u2248 i c /4. current growth rate k 1 , the longer the time to detect it above the noise inherent to the finite sampling.",

During this short time, the damage remains limited. The infection numbers will have risen by a multiplicative factor between 2 and 3. This degree of control must be compared to a situation where no information on the current growth rate is available, and where the first effects of a new policy are seen in the increased number of symptomatic, sick people only 10-14 days later. Over this time span, with a growth rate of k 1 = 0.23, the infection numbers will have grown by a factor of 10-30 before one realizes eventually that an intervention must be made. Random testing decreases both the time scale until informed policy adjustments can be taken and the temporal fluctuations of the infection numbers. As in any feedback and control loop, the more frequent the testing is, the shorter are the delay times, and thus the smaller are the fluctuations. The various benefits of increasing the testing frequency are shown in Fig. 5 , which are obtained by simulating a specific mitigation strategy, where we built in the uncertainty about the efficacy of political interventions.

If additional restrictions such as physical distancing etc., are imposed, \u2206T increases by a modest factor and one can get by with indirectly proportionally fewer tests per day. Nevertheless, on the order of 1 million tests per day is a minimal requirement for massive testing to contain the pandemics without further measures. However, even while the Swiss capabilities are still far from reaching 1 million tests per day, testing for infections offers two important benefits in addition to identifying people that need to be quarantined. First, properly randomized testing allows to monitor and study the efficiency of measures that keep the reproduction number R below 1. This ensures that the growth rate k of case numbers and new infections is negative, k < 0. Second, frequent testing, even if applied to randomly selected people, helps suppress the reproduction number R and thus allows policy to be less restrictive in terms of other measures, such as physical distancing.",

In case the measures should still be insufficient, one can measure the current growth rates and monitor the effect of additional restrictive measures. 4 It is important that the set of randomly selected people must change constantly, so that it should happen extremely rarely that a given person is tested twice. 5 Here, we solely focus on a person being infectious, but not on whether the person has developed antibodies. The latter test indicates that the person has been infected any time in the past. Testing for antibodies and (potential) immunity has its own virtues, but aims at different goals from the random testing for infections that we advocate here. By following the fraction of infections as a function of time, we can determine nearly instantaneously the growth rate of infections, k(t), and thus assess and quantify the effectiveness of socio-economic restrictions through the observed changes in k following a change in policy. This monitoring can even be carried out in a regionally resolved way, such that subsequently, restrictive or relaxing measures can be adapted to different regions (urban/rural etc.). 6 A suppression of the COVID-19 pandemic is achieved if, for a sufficiently long time, the number of infections decays exponentially with time. Mitigation aims to reduce the exponential rate of growth in the number of infections. Stability is achieved when that number tends to a constant. Once stability is reached, one may start relaxing the restrictions step by step and monitor the effect on the growth rate k as a function of geographic regions.",

In case the infection rate drops significantly below i * , one can safely afford to have a positive growth rate k. We thus assume that if i(t)/i * falls below some threshold i low = 0.2, we intervene by relaxing some measures, that we assume to increase k by an amount uniformly distributed in [0, k 1 ], but without letting k exceed the maximal value of k high = 0.23. Likewise, one should intervene when the fraction i(t) grows too large. We do so when i(t)/i * exceeds i high = 3.

The initial infected fraction and growth rate are i(0) = i c /4 = 0.0007 and k 1 = 0.1, respectively, with a sampling interval of one day.

This is in stark contrast to the nearly 14 days of delay required for symptomatic individuals to emerge in statistically significant numbers. After such a time delay a huge increase (a factor of order 20) of infection numbers may have already occurred, which would be catastrophic. Daily random testing safely prevents this. Thereby the significant reduction of the time delay is absolutely crucial. Note that without daily polling of infection numbers and without knowledge about the quantitative effect of restriction measures, a reboot of the economy could not be risked before the number of infections has been suppressed by at least a factor of 10-20 below the current level. Given the limits of suppression rates that can be achieved without most draconic lockdown measures, this will require a very long time and thus translates into an enormous economic cost. In contrast, daily polling will allow us to carefully reboot the economy and adjust restrictive measures, while closely monitoring their effect. Since the reaction times are so much shorter, one can safely start an attempted reboot already at infection numbers corresponding roughly to the status quo.",

After the limit of the health system, i c , has been reached, a lockdown brings i down again. The exponential rate of decrease is expected to be very slow, unless extreme measures are imposed. The release of measures upon a reboot is likely to re-induce exponential growth, but with a rate difficult to predict. Three possible outcomes are shown in blue curves in the scenario without testing feedback, where the effect of the new measures becomes visible only after a delay of 10-14 days. In the worst case, i grows by a multiplicative factor of order 20 before the growth is detected. A reboot can thus be risked only once i \u2264 i * * \u2261 i c /20, implying a very long time in lockdown after the initial peak. Due to the long delay until policy changes show observable effects, the fluctuations of i will be large. Random testing (the red curve) has a major advantage. It measures i instantaneously and detects its growth rate within few days, whereby the higher the testing rate the faster the detection. Policy adjustments can thus be made much faster, with smaller oscillations of i. A safe reboot is then possible much earlier, at the level of i \u2264 i * \u2248 i c /4.",
