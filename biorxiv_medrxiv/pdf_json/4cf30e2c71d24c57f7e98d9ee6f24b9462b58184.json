This paper is the first systematic attempt to provide estimates on how many people would contract the virus and how many would die in the coming few months across Africa.",

STATA's Lasso software for model selection was used to narrow down the list of covariates (28) . Furthermore, out of the 193 countries captured in our data, for a few countries, data were unavailable for selected variables, namely air traffic (25 countries), adherence to international health regulation (20 countries), and household size (24 countries). To bridge the gap, we performed multiple imputation procedures, particularly by running 1000 imputations and 99 000 iterations using STATA's multiple imputation routine (29, 30).

The quantity in the square bracket represents age-standardized estimated number of deaths in country y, if age-specific fatality rates were to follow those of the standard populations. However, our study population differs from the two countries not just with respect to age structure but also living standard and health system readiness. Hence, to adjust the estimated deaths further we developed a correction factor that links the socio-economic status and health system readiness of each country with those two populations, which is represented by . In this case, is a geometric-mean of socio-demographic index (S) and health access and quality index (Q), and the relevant data for each country was sourced from IHME (21, 22) . Analysis was performed using STATA version 16.0 (33). Figure A1 in the Appendix shows a graphical comparison of observed and predicated COVID-19 confirmed cases (in log scale). Table A1 presents results from the cross-fold robustness test for the predictive model. The statistical diagnostic tests as well the patterns from the graphical analysis suggest that the predicative model sufficiently captures the observed data. As can be seen from the table, not only the RMSE, the MAE and the Pseudo-R 2 are consistent across samples, the error margins are also small. Hence, we have used the resulting model to forecast cumulative COVID-19 cases, estimate new infections and deaths from COVID-19 for each of the 47 African countries which have reported at least one case as of March 31, 2020. Table 1 presents cumulative COVID-19 cases and prevalence rates for Africa and its five sub-regions for the period April 1 to June 30 2020. By the end of April cumulated infection across the region will reach 2,459,328 cases (CI 95% 424,155 to 14,380,080), and will further increase to 16, 283, 084 (CI 95% 2,718,402 to 98, 358, 798) by June 30, 2020. During the same period, cumulative cases in the hardest hit sub-region in the African continent, Northern Africa, is predicted to increase from 1.3 million at the end of April (CI 95% 207982 to 7,914,479) to over 7.5 million by June 30, 2020. This is followed by Southern, Western, and Central Africa sub-regions. Throughout the forecast period, Eastern Africa is predicated to experience the lowest case load and prevalence rate in the continent throughout the forecast period. .

The estimates are for the month of April 2020. The first COVID-19 case in Africa was reported on February 14,2020 (2, 3). Our estimates suggest that at the end of April, after two months since the first COVID-19 cases were reported in the region, the number of deaths is expected to reach over 3 thousand deaths (CI 95% 537 to 18482). Most deaths in the region will come from the Northern Africa sub-region, which, as reported earlier, also had the largest number of COVID-19 cases and the highest prevalence rates of all sub-regions in the content. Southern and Western Africa are expected to experience comparable death toll, while deaths in the Eastern Africa sub-region are expected to be the lowest of the sub-regions in Africa. Some countries such as Algeria, Morocco and South Africa are expected to experience the highest number of causalities since the beginning of the pandemic, in excess of 400 deaths.

The association with community and population level characteristics is even more limited, hence largely speculative. In this context, the task of developing a multi-country covariate-based predictive model for COVID-19 in any country or region of the world, let alone Africa, is likely to be guided by what is feasible, and to the extent, the available data permits it. It also means that there is a need for constant revision of predictive models as new data becomes available. In our case, the work is further complicated because in Africa data on key covariates are either lacking or when they exist tend to be biased or derived from other global covariate-based modeling exercises (21, 22) .",

Additionally, our model performance was assessed through rigorous out of sample calibration using k-fold cross-validation techniques and obtaining robust results. We have also restricted our forecast to the first few months (April-June) and refrained from long term exercise. This is because first we anticipate new and additional data that is more informative and will lead to better and improved estimates. Second, in the face of sparse data any long-term projection is more likely to be detached from reality and easily become a wild guess, and less useful to policy actions. Third, if the countries of the region will not have been able to put effective strategies to contain the disease before the end of June, the last month of our projection period, the extent and consequence of COVID-19 on the continent would be more than any predictive model can anticipate.",

In the Southern Africa sub-region, South Africa, which has a proportionately higher urban population and greater international connectivity, is also projected to lead the rest of the pack in terms of new infections rates. In the Eastern Africa sub-region, Kenya, which is relatively more urbanized has a higher per capita incidence rate in comparison to other countries within the sub-region. However, it is to be noted that some of these countries also have higher living standards and better health system than most countries in the region.

As an information and health communication tool, mobile platforms could also be leveraged to deliver appropriate health messages to the population relieving direct consultation pressure from health system providers Efficient resource allocation and use is only feasible where there is improved visibility across the various components of the health system through high quality health information systems (54). Ideally, this should cover key areas such as human resources for health, infrastructure and equipment, medicines and other health commodities, and financial resources available. This is particularly needed in epidemic situations, where there are often huge distortions in demand for resources, that if not well addressed could lead to wastage and suboptimal population health outcomes.",

It is, therefore, important that governments include marginalized communities, such as refugees, migrants and internally displaced populations (IDPs) in their policies and actions. Across Africa, approximately 12.3 million people remain forcibly displaced, including 8.1 million internally displaced people and 4.2 million refugees (55) . Moreover, Sub-Saharan Africa alone hosts more than 26% of the world's refugee population (56, 57) . These populations are likely to face a different set of constraints that restricts their ability to prevent themselves from getting infected and accessing health care. The fact that they also live in under difficult circumstances means that governments across the region should maintain critical supply corridors for humanitarian assistance and address the needs of the most vulnerable within their borders. In the longer term this pandemic should also be a call for African governments to further strengthen engagement with international humanitarian actors in order to foster strong partnership building on local capacities.",

The measurement framework should be agile yet comprehensive, rather than being piecemeal. It should seek to combine data from multiple sources within the healthcare system into a joint assessment framework such that a consistent and informative narrative emerges to tackle the epidemic. The ageold call for accurate health metrics to address population health still remains valid. Our best estimates presented in the paper are forecast, and their ability to capture reality is as good as the underlying data. It is thus imperative to review the model and the results as new data becomes available, and update the estimates accordingly.",
