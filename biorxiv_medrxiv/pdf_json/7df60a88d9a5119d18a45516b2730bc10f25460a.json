Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a 20 positive-stranded RNA betacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae. Expanding virus populations, as 21 that of SARS-CoV-2, accumulate a number of narrowly shared polymorphisms imposing a 22 confounding effect on traditional clustering methods. In this context, approaches that reduce the 23 complexity of the sequence space occupied by the SARS-CoV-2 population are necessary for a robust 24 clustering. Here, we proposed the subdivision of the global SARS-CoV-2 population into sixteen well-25 defined subtypes by focusing on the widely shared polymorphisms in nonstructural (nsp3, nsp4, nsp6, 26 nsp12, nsp13 and nsp14) cistrons, structural (spike and nucleocapsid) and accessory (ORF8) genes.",
