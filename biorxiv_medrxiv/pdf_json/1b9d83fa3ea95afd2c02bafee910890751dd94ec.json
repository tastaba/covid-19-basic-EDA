            "text": "The case fatality rate (CFR) of a disease refers to the proportion of death within those infected from the disease. The CFR of an emerging infectious disease can only be determined after its outbreak, but the real-time CFR estimation during the disease outbreak, especially in the early stage, has to be made for public health decisions. There are two naive, simple methods to estimate CFR at a time point t using the cumulative number of deaths, recoveries, and confirmed cases at t. Denote D(t), R(t), and C(t) be the observed number of deaths, recoveries, and confirmed cases at day t. The first simple estimator equals D(t)/C(t) and the second simple estimator equals D(t)/[D(t)+R(t)]. Note that these two estimators are equivalent after the outbreak when D(t)+R(t)=C(t). 1 The second estimator usually outperforms the first estimator as there existed a time lag between the diagnosis of disease and death. [2] [3] [4] [5] The second estimator at any stage of the outbreak would be unbiased if the proportion of confirmed deaths equals the proportion of unconfirmed deaths. 1 This is the case for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 where the time from confirmed diagnosis to death equaled that from confirmed diagnosis to recovery (=23 days 1 ). For novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the duration from diagnosis to death was much shorter, with a mean duration of 8-14 days. [2] [3] [4] [5] With survivors being hospitalized longer than the deaths, we can expect that the second CFR estimator (hereby referred to as the simple CFR estimator) would overestimate the actual CFR as deaths were more likely to be observed earlier in the outbreak. During the COVID-19 outbreak, many researchers have developed new methods to estimate CFR that replace the nominator or denominator by the relevant figures 8 to 14 days ago to reduce the biasedness of the simple CFR estimator. [2] [3] [4] [5] However, this approach ignored the underlying process of how these numbers (deaths, recoveries, and total confirmed cases) were generated and these methods were regarded as invalid. 6 .
