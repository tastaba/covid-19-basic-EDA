In this endeavor, theoretical modelling can play a crucial role. Traditional epidemiological models that assume universal or constant infection parameters are not sufficient to address case specific strategies like contact tracing. Therefore, we have developed an agent-based epidemiological model which takes into account the fact that disease transmission is differentiated in distinct arenas of social life that each play a different role in a lockdown: The family, the workplace, our social circles, and the public sphere. This subdivision becomes especially important when discussing such efforts as contact tracing. Using an estimated weight of social contacts within each of these four spheres 1 we discuss effect of various mitigation strategies.",

First, how a lockdown is most effectively implemented, and second, how society is subsequently reopened safely, and yet as fast as possible. To answer the first, we must examine the relative effects of reducing the amount of contacts in the workplace, in public spaces, and in closely connected groups of friends. For the second question, we will look for viable strategies for mitigation that do not require a total lockdown. Here, we will especially focus on effective testing, contact tracing, and improved hygiene. Our results will hopefully be helpful in Figure 1 . A diagram of the model structure. Each agent has a network consisting of a family, a workplace and two groups of friends. The family accounts for 40 % of interactions. Work accounts for 30 % and socialisation with friends accounts for a further 15 %. The contacts in each of these three groups are fixed throughout the simulation. Finally, 15 % of interactions happen \"in public\", which we represent as an interaction with a randomly chosen other agent. Everyone in the work and friend sub-graphs are assumed to be connected to each other. Below the graph, the underlying mechanisms of the disease are shown. We divide the exposed state into four in order to get a more naturalistic distribution of incubation periods. In our simulation we set the average family group to 2, the work network to 10 completely interconnected people and the friend network consist of 2 groups with on average 5 in each.

(a) Comparison of various strategies with and without a reduction in transmission probability per encounter. It can be seen that work and social contacts play roughly the same part in disease transmission. A reduction of infection probability makes the strategies relatively more effective. Reducing work contacts, for example, lowers the peak height by roughly 20 % (relative to no intervention) if infection probability is high. If the infection probability is lowered, the strategy causes a 36 % decrease in peak height (relative to only reducing infection probability and not number of work contacts). (b) A similar comparison of the effects of reducing workplace sizes by half. This strategy is also relatively more effective if infection probability is reduced. The strategy reduces peak height by 28 % at a lowered infection probability versus only 12 % if infection probability remains high.",

Therefore, we will here implement a crude form of contact tracing where we 1) close the workplaces of people who are tested positive for the disease, 2) isolate their regular social contacts for a limited period, and 3) test people for COVID-19 just before they exit the quarantine. We will see that such a 1 step tracing and quarantine strategy (1STQ) can give a sizeable reduction in disease spread while costing fewer lost workdays than overall lockdown. Our simulations include the limitations imposed by not being able to trace the estimated 15 % of infections from random public transmissions. Thus our strategy does not require sophisticated contact tracing but could be implemented based on infected people being able to recollect their recent personal encounters with friends. Fig. 3 (a,b,c) examines how increased detection efficiency systematically improves our ability to reduce the peak disease burden. This would then be a more cost-efficient way to mitigate the pandemic than a complete and persistent lockdown where each person would lose several man-months. Even detecting as little as 2 % of Covid-19 infected per day (which with an average disease duration of 5 days correspond to finding approximately 10 % of the infected) can potentially reduce the peak number of cases by 30 % . If 10 % efficiency is possible, corresponding to detecting about half of infectious cases, then peak height could be reduced by a factor 3, and with less than 12 quarantine days per person during the entire epidemic. This is illustrated in fig. 3 (b) .",

In comparison one has to consider that a society-wide lockdown with similar reduction in peak height would have to last for about 100 days (see fig. 2 ). Thus, the lockdown would require of order 100 days of quarantine (or at least extensive social distancing) per person, whereas testing and isolation only requires on average around 20 days per person with a 14-day quarantine (with a 5-day quarantine, it is only slightly more than five days).

(c) and (d) show peak fraction of population infected (left y-axis) and time spent in quarantine (right y-axis) as a function of testing chance and quarantine length. The average number of days spent in quarantine was calculated using our standard group sizes, such that each person is connected to approximately 20 others. The days spent in quarantine scale proportionally to this assumed connectivity. (c) With a quarantine length of 5 days, it is possible to reduce the peak number of infected by almost ten percentage points, corresponding to a 30 % drop, if the probability of infected people being tested is only 2 % per day of illness.",
