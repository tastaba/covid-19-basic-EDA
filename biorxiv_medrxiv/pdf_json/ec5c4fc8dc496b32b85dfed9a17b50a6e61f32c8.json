Justified by the sigmoidal nature of a pandemic, i.e. initial exponential spread to eventual saturation, we apply the GM to the first corona pandemic wave using data from 25 countries, for which a sufficient amount of not yet fully developed data exists, as of April 2, 2020, and study the model's predictions. We find that logarithmic daily fatalities caused by Covid-19 are well described by a quadratic function in time. By fitting the data to second order polynomials from a statistical \u03c7 2 -fit with 95% confidence, we are able to obtain the characteristic parameters of the GM, i.e. a width, peak height and time of peak, for each country separately. We provide evidence that this supposedly oversimplifying model might still have predictive power and use it to forecast the further course of the fatalities caused by Covid-19 per country, including peak number of deaths per day, date of peak, and duration within most deaths occur. While our main goal is to present the general idea of the simple modeling process using GMs, we also describe possible estimates for the number of required respiratory machines and the duration left until the number of infected will be significantly reduced.",

Stateof-the-art modeling efforts had been summarized very recently elsewhere [3] . Many of these models are either toy models that cannot make reliable predictions or they are so complex, by taking into account a wide range of factors, that simple predictions are not possible. In times of the coronavirus epidemic, fast predictions on the course of the coronavirus disease are crucial for policy makers to optimize their managing of the disease wave. To feed into the current debate on infectious disease models, we would like to propose the GM as a simple, but effective description of fatalities caused by Covid-19 over time, similar to a recent study [8] that focused on the analysis of doubling times for Germany reported by a newspaper. In contrast to this previous work, we chose to use the reported daily death rates [5] as monitored input data, because in nearly all countries these are better documented than the monitored daily infections and have a significant lower number of unreported cases. We also do not rely on doubling times as their determination is model-dependent.",

We here study the predictions for these quantities of interest based on a GM for all those countries for which sufficient -to be made precise below -amounts of data already existed as of April 2nd. We only present the conceptual idea of such a process in form of a sort of recipe and hope to spark motivation for people to quickly recreate GM time evolutions, determine the three model parameters for their country, city, environment, as will be explained in detail, to be able to make predictions While the GM may appear too simple to be predictive, it does fit the past data well, including the entire first epidemic wave in China, and hence must have at lease some predictive power for data to come. Please note, though, that we are no epidemiologists and have no prior expertise in the modelling of diseases. Also, with the here presented GM we dare, by no means, to present a model capable of similar mechanistic and causal richness compared with existing infectious disease models. Our only addition is to note and use for predictions the macroscopic Gaussian nature of the time evolution of daily fatalities that is universal among all countries and, in fact, almost necessarily so given the sigmoidal nature of total fatalities -a point we will explain in detail in the discussion.",

To do so, we fitted a polynomial of second order to the logarithmic number of daily fatalities of 14 countries as a function of time using a \u03c7 2 -fit. The resulting quadratic fit is plotted in Fig. 2 We recall that we prefer to base any quantitative conclusions only on the number of deaths, and not on the number of infections per day. Deaths are better documented than monitored infections in nearly all countries. A death caused by Covid-19 is easier to count than an infection, which might as well cause none to moderate symptoms and hence might remain uncounted. Statistically, a constant fraction of infected die from Covid-19 at a later time after being registered as infected [3, 10] . Thus, infection and death curves are equivalent descriptions of time evolution of Covid-19, and the coefficients characterizing their shape can be expected to be closely related. To demonstrate that both, infections and deaths, follow the GM, we analyzed and show results for both measures.",

Daily infections, daily fatalities, cumulative infections and cumulative fatalities, all fit neatly onto the unit GM curve, plotted in gray in the back for reference. China, which is the only country to provide data from its first pandemic wave for times greater than 0.6 (in normalized units), fits to the GM well over the entire significant course of infections and fatalities. This sparks the hope that the used GM will have predictive power for the remaining countries also after the maximum. The fits already provide sufficient evidence that the part prior to the maximum is captured well by the GM. The resulting GM parameters are listed and plotted in Fig.  4 . For most countries the GM width is within 10 and 15 days, roughly half of all countries have passed their peak of daily fatalities already and the peak is roughly below 20 fatalities per day and per million people.",

We hope that the reader uses the following examples as incentive and inspiration to produce their own predictions based on the GM. First, the time evolution of the number of cumulative fatalities, plotted in Fig. 5 , can be obtained by summing daily number of deaths, predicted by our model.

It also predicts the cumulative number of fatalities per million people over the entire course of the Covid-19 disease to be highest for France, Spain and Italy. Next, we estimate the number of required respiratory machines per date for the Covid-19 epidemic. We start by assuming the number of respiratory machines per day to be equal to the cumulative number of active seriously sick persons on the given date, where active means not yet recovered by that date. Each new seriously sick person per day (SSP) requires a respiratory machine for some days or even weeks before passing away or recovering from Covid-19. According to other works [10] , people to have died from Covid-19 occupied respiratory equipment for an average of 7 days prior to their death, but respiratory equipment may be in use for up to about one month for cases that later recovered. Thus, we may roughly estimate the number of active SSPs per date as the sum of people that became seriously sick within the past 10 days.

Stevens investigated what happens when simulitis spreads in a town, if everyone in the town starts at a random position, moving at a random angle, infecting others upon collision, and recovering after a certain time. The simulated number of infected people rises rapidly as the disease spreads and tapers off as people recover. We recreated the simulations and found evidence for the applicability of the GM under many circumstances. These results are not reported here, but support our central assumption. From another recent work using a holistic agent-based model [2] , where the agents adapt their behavior through artificial intelligence as part of the solution, there seems also evidence from the numerical results presented, that the number of newly infected may be well captured by a Gaussian function.",

Intuitively, we know that the cumulative number of casualties for a wave of any pandemic must start from a constant (often 0), then increase exponentially and eventually saturate at a higher constant level. Functions that capture such a behavior, i.e. a smooth change from a lower constant to a higher constant over a finite duration, are called sigmoidal. The derivative of sigmoidal functions have a bell-shaped form, similar to a Gaussian function, but in general can be asymmetric. We here model the daily fatalities, formally the derivative of the cumulative fatalities. Since we expect the cumulative fatali-ties to be sigmoidal, from common-sense reasoning as argued above, this fixes the derivative, the daily fatalities, to a bellshaped form. Even though all pandemics thus give rise to bell-shaped change in casualties, the curve's parameters might differ, influenced mostly by policy, health system and culture. The predictive power of our model rests on the assumption that these influences are encoded already into the early data of casualties, combined with the assumption that the principal shape of all pandemics is fixed. Why do we choose a symmetric bell-shaped form, the Gaussian function? Three aspects: fist a symmetric function is the simplest model among all bell-shaped functions and thus suffices to convey the idea of such models. Second, it works, in the sense discussed here. And third, the times of greatest interest to policy makers are until the bell-curve's peak since once passed the health system should be able to cope.",

In our experiments we found such fits to be generally sensitive to initial conditions and to often require a large number of parameters. We therefore chose to fit the logarithm of daily change of cases instead of the cumulative cases. The logarithm of daily change of cases weights more strongly values close to the functions maximum and disregards other values. This leads to a more stable model of the daily change of cases around its maximum, the turning point of the cumulative cases and the time of interest since most relevant predictions such as peak of the pandemic, time point and width of peak are focused around it.",

There are many countries not yet drastically affected by Covid-19, which will likely change for many in the coming weeks, and the GM could for example be used to apply it to such countries as soon as sufficient data is available. Besides that we hope to make the public aware of the Gaussian or sigmoidal nature emerging from Covid-19 infections, similar to the numerous discussions of exponential growth in recent times. No pandemic is ever exponential, in the long run it is sigmoidal, and thus makes for a good discussion.",
