Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that age is one of the strongest risk factors influencing the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. Here, we interrogate the transcriptional features and cellular landscapes of the aging human lung through integrative analysis of bulk and single-cell transcriptomics. By intersecting these age-associated changes with prior experimental data on host interactions between SARS-CoV-2 or its relative SARS-CoV, we identify several age-associated factors that may contribute to the heightened severity of COVID-19 in older populations. These analyses illuminate potential avenues for further studies on the relationship between the aging lung and COVID-19 pathogenesis, which may inform strategies to more effectively treat this disease.",

Similarly, in the United States, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) estimated that from February 12 to March 16, 2020, the case-fatality rate of patients 55-64 years old was 1.4 -2%, and 10.4 -27.3% for patients \u2265 85 years old 5 (Figure 1a) . Furthermore, a recent analysis of Chinese CDC data revealed that while patients of all ages shared a similar probability of becoming infected by SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 6-8, the clinical manifestations of infection in children (< 18 years old) were less severe than in adults. With the exception of infants and younger children (< 1 years old and 1-5 years old, respectively), most children were asymptomatic or experienced mild illness9. Collectively, these observations indicate a strong association between age and COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. However, it must be emphasized that younger patients can still frequently contract the disease, possibly leading to hospitalization, ICU admission, or death (Supplementary Figure 1) .",

A total of 578 lung RNA-seq profiles were compiled, of which 31.66% were from women. An initial hypothesis for why SARS-CoV-2 differentially affects patients of varying ages is that the expression of host factors essential for SARS-CoV-2 infection may increase with aging. To assess this possibility, we examined the gene expression of ACE2, which encodes the protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 that is coopted as the host receptor for SARS- [12] [13] [14] [15] There was no statistically significant association between age and ACE2 expression levels (Kruskal-Wallis test, p = 0.92) (Figure 1c) . While ACE2 is the direct cell surface receptor for SARS-CoV-2, transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and cathepsin L (CTSL) have been demonstrated to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection by priming the spike protein for host cell entry14.",

With a stringent cutoff of adjusted p < 0.0001, we identified two clusters of genes in which their expression progressively changes with age (Figure 1d) .

These findings are consistent with known physiologic changes of aging, including decreased pulmonary compliance25, and heightened risk for thrombotic diseases26. Of note, deregulation of the renin-angiotensin system has been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury induced by SARS-CoV 27,28, the closely related coronavirus responsible for the SARS epidemic of 2002-2003 29. In mice, SARS-CoV infection downregulates ACE2, leading to disinhibition of angiotensin II production by ACE 27, 28, [30] [31] [32] and subsequent vasoconstriction. A possible hypothesis is that increased baseline vascular smooth muscle contraction in older patients may predispose the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the setting of SARS-CoV and/or SARS-CoV-2 infection. In line with this hypothesis, recent analyses of COVID-19 cohorts in China have found that patients with hypertension were significantly more likely to develop ARDS17 and require ICU admission33, though we note that correlative epidemiologic studies do not necessarily demonstrate causality.",

Of note, Cluster 2 was also enriched for genes involved in lipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, peroxisome, and lysosomal membranes. Age-associated alterations in lipid metabolism could impact SARS-CoV-2 infection, as SARS-CoV can enter cells through cholesterol-rich lipid rafts 37-40. Similarly, age-associated alterations in lysosomes could influence late endocytic viral entry, as the protease cathepsin L cleaves SARS-CoV spike proteins from within lysosomes 41,42. Having compiled a high-confidence set of age-associated genes, we sought to identify the lung cell types that normally express these genes, using the human lung single cell transcriptomics dataset from the Tissue Stability Cell Atlas19. By examining the scaled percentage of expressing cells within each cell subset, we identified age-associated genes predominantly enriched in different cell types. Cell types with highly enriched expression for certain Cluster 1 genes (increasing with age) included fibroblasts, muscle cells, and lymph vessels (Figure 2a) . In contrast, cell types with highly enriched expression for certain Cluster 2 genes (decreasing with age) included macrophages, dividing dendritic cells (DCs)/monocytes, and AT2 cells (Figure 2b) . Examining the muscle-enriched genes that increased in expression with age, gene ontology analysis revealed enrichment for vascular smooth muscle contraction, cGMP-PKG signaling, Z-disc, and actin cytoskeleton, among other pathways ( Figure 2c) . As for the AT2-enriched genes that decreased in expression with age, gene ontology analysis revealed enrichment for metabolic pathways, biosynthesis of antibiotics, lipid metabolism, extracellular exosome, and mitochondrial matrix (Figure 2d) . A subset of these enriched gene ontologies had also been identified by the bulk RNAseq analysis (Figure 1e-f) . Thus, integrative analysis of bulk and single-cell transcriptomes revealed that many of the age-associated transcriptional changes in human lung can be mapped to specific cell subpopulations, suggesting that either the transcriptional status, or overall abundance of these cell types, or both, may be altered with aging.",

To investigate the cellular landscape of the aging lung, we applied a gene signature-based approach45 to infer the enrichment of different cell types from the bulk RNA-seq profiles. Since bulk RNA-seq measures the average expression of genes within a cell population, such datasets will reflect the relative proportions of the cell types that comprised the input population, though with the caveat that cell types can have overlapping expression profiles and such profiles may be altered in response to stimuli. Using this approach, we identified ageassociated alterations in the enrichment scores of several cell types (Figure 3a) . Whereas epithelial cells decreased with age, fibroblasts increased with age (Figure 3b ). This finding is consistent with the progressive loss of lung parenchyma due to reduced regenerative capacity of the aging lung46, as well as the increased risk for diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pulmonary fibrosis47. In addition, these results are concordant with the findings from analysis of human lung single-cell transcriptomes (Figure 2a-b) .",

In line with this, we observed that the age-associated changes in macrophages were specifically attributed to the pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage subset but not the immunoregulatory M2 subset 58 (Figure 3c) , though this binary classification scheme represents an oversimplification of macrophage function. Nevertheless, elucidating the consequences of age-associated changes in lung macrophages may reveal insights into the differential outcomes of older patients with COVID-19.

A recent study interrogated the human host factors that interact with 27 different SARS-CoV-2 proteins 64, revealing the SARS-CoV-2 : Human protein interactome in cell lines expressing recombinant SARS-CoV-2 proteins. By cross-referencing the interacting host factors with the set of age-associated genes, we identified 20 factors at the intersection ( Figure   5a ). 4 of these genes showed an increase in expression with age (i.e. Cluster 1 genes), while 16 decreased in expression with age (Cluster 2 genes). Mapping these factors to their interacting SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we noted that the age-associated host factors which interact with M, Nsp13, Nsp1, Nsp7, Nsp8, Orf3a, Orf8, Orf9c, and Orf10 proteins generally decrease in expression with aging (Figure 5b ). However, a notable exception was Nsp12, as the age-associated hostfactors that interact with Nsp12 both showed increased expression with aging (CRTC3 and MYCBP2) (Figure 5c ). Nsp12 encodes for the primary RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2, and is a prime target for developing therapies against COVID-19. The observation that CRTC3 and MYCBP2 increase in expression with aging is intriguing, as these genes may be related to the activity of Nsp12/RdRp in host cells. Of note, MYCBP2 is a known repressor of cAMP signaling 65,66, and cAMP signaling potently inhibits contraction of airway smooth muscle cells 67. Thus, age-associated increases in MYCBP2 could promote smooth muscle contraction, which is concordant with our analyses on age-associated gene signatures in the lung (Figure 1e ). MYCBP2 might therefore possibly contribute to COVID-19 pathology by not only interacting with SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, but also through its normal physiologic role in promoting smooth muscle contraction.",

By integrating these data with single cell transcriptomes of human lung tissue, we further pinpointed the specific cell types that normally express the age-associated genes. We showed that epithelial cells, macrophages, and Th1 cells decrease in abundance with age, whereas fibroblasts and pericytes increase in abundance with age. These systematic changes in tissue composition and cell interactions can potentially propagate positive feedback loops that predispose the airways to pathological contraction 68. Notably, some of the age-associated genes have been previously identified as host factors with a functional role in SARS-CoV replication 63, and a fraction of the age-associated factors have been shown to directly interact with the SARS-CoV-2 proteome64. Whether any of these age-associated changes causally contribute to the heightened susceptibility of COVID-19 in older populations remains to be experimentally tested.",

Instead, we hope that these analyses will illuminate new directions for subsequent research efforts on SARS-CoV-2 by generating hypotheses for why advanced age is one of the strongest risk factors for COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.
