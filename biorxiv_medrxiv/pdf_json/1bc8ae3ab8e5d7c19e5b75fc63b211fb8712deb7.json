We recognize it as the principal factor which critically suppresses the growth of novel viral epidemics. The mechanism of this suppression has a well known evolutionary nature. In plain words, once viruses get under attack of the immune systems of the infected humans, they mutate to survive in the hostile environment. Given the diminutive scale of the virus reproduction time, it is fair to assume that viruses may mutate quite fast on the human timescale. And by evolutionary principle, a less pathogenic virus strain has better survival chances. When a statistically significant number of people get infected, there should be a large number of them with strong immunity that facilitates less pathogenic virus mutations. As these people transmit their weaken strain to others, we observe some natural cross-immunisation.",

Now it is important to understand the effect of the mutation factor m on the epidemic in this model.Like the SIR model, the SIMR model keeps the sum ( ) + ( ) + ( ) + ( ) = 1 constant. Point S = 1, I = M = R = 0 corresponds to the state with no infected people. Small deviations from it develop in time according to the law \u221d exp[((1 \u2212 ) \u2212 ) ]. The emergence of the epidemic and its further development is controlled in the SIMR model by the only dimensionless parameter = (1 \u2212 ) / . At a sufficiently high rate of spread of the virus , when > 1, the fraction of sick people begins to grow and an epidemic occurs.A typical course of the development of the epidemic when mutations are taken into account is presented inFig.2. SIMR epidemic development (m = 0.2, \u03b2 = 0.6, \u03b3 = 0.05). The red line indicates that at the peak of the epidemic, the percentage of hidden immunization ( ) is approximately 70%.",
