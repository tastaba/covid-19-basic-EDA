During this early period, potential controls were not effectively put in place or enforced in many countries. Hence, the early phases of COVID-19 spread in countries where controls were weak offer a unique perspective on the ensemble-behavior of COVID-19 basic reproduction number Ro. The work here shows that there is global convergence (i.e. across many nations) to an uncontrolled Ro = 4.5 that describes the early time spread of COVID-19. This value is in agreement with independent estimates from other sources reviewed here and adds to the growing consensus that the early estimate of Ro = 2.2 adopted by the World Health Organization is low. A reconciliation between power-law and exponential growth predictions is also featured within the confines of the SIR formulation. Implications for evaluating potential control strategies from this uncontrolled Ro are briefly discussed in the context of the maximum possible infected fraction of the population (needed for assessing health care capacity) and mortality (especially in the USA given diverging projections). Model results indicate that if intervention measures still result in Ro > 2.7 within 49 days after first infection, intervention is unlikely to be effective in general for COVID-19. Current optimistic projections place mortality figures in the USA in the range of 100,000 fatalities. For fatalities to be confined to 100,000 requires a reduction in Ro from 4.5 to 2.7 within 17 days of first infection assuming a mortality rate of 3.4%. This rapid reduction in Ro is outside the range of possibilities for the USA.",

This dispute moved inoculation from the domain of philosophy, religion, and disjointed trials plagued by high uncertainty into a debate about mathematical models -put forth by Daniel Bernoulli (in 1766) and Jean-Baptiste le Rond D'Alembert (in 1761), both dealing with competing risks of death and interpretation of trials [1] . Since then, the mathematical description of infectious diseases continues to draw significant attention from researchers and practitioners in governments and health agencies alike. Even news agencies are now seeking out explanations to models so as to offer advice and clarity to their audiences during the (near-continuous) coverage of the spread of COVID-19 [2] . The prospect of using mathematical models in conjunction with data is succinctly summarized by the Nobel laureate Ronald Ross, whose 1916 abstract [3] enlightens the role of mathematics in epidemiology today. A quotation from this abstract below, which foreshadows the requirements and challenges for mathematical models to describe emerging epidemics such as COVID-19 [4, 5] , needs no further elaboration:",

Moreover, this system requires the specification of 3 initial conditions S(0), I(0), and R(0). For COVID-19, it is assumed that R(0) = 0 and I(0) << S(0). For the initial conditions selected here, N = S(0) + I(0) + R(0) \u2248 S(0), which is labeled S o for consistency with the SIR litera-ture. The basis of the latter assumption is that the number of deceased individuals is << N . The dynamical system in equation (3) has only one equilibrium point: I = 0 for any S and R, which is a disease-free stable equilibrium. The SIR model makes a number of assumptions, including a closed system with no changes in natural births or natural deaths occurring during the short-lived outbreak. The infection is assumed to have negligible latent period so that an individual becomes infectious when infected. Disease transmission occurs through individual-to-individual contact directly (skinto-skin), indirectly (skin-infected surfaces), or airborne (pathogens transmitted through air by small particles after coughing or sneezing). Recovering from infection is also assumed to confer long-term immunity, yet to be verified for COVID-19. The most objectionable assumption in SIR dynamics is the use of the mass-action principle. As with all compartment models, mass action assumes that the rate of encounter between I and S is proportional to their product. For this assumption to hold, it requires that members of I and S be uniformly distributed in the space of the compartment [18] . Individuals -unlike molecules in an ideal solution within a closed container -do not mix homogeneously. At minimum, the use of the mass action principle serves as a reference model to compare more detailed mechanisms or explore data. The parameters \u03b3 and \u03b2 encode the main properties of the epidemics and the population response to it. The \u03b3 = 1/D is generally interpreted as the inverse of the mean recovery time D. The D varies with the nature of the disease and the recovery from it which depends on the medical facilities and resources available. For COVID-19, the best information on the speed of recovery comes from a World Health Organization study examining more than 55000 cases in China [19] . They found that for mild illness, the time from the onset of symptoms to natural recovery is, on average, 14 days. This estimate was also supported in other published studies [e.g. 20], though as much as 6-8 weeks were recorded for severe infections. Because I is dominated by mild cases thus far, D = 14 d is selected here.",

Hence, \u03b2 = k T r . Factors such as hand-washing and sanitizing reduce T r whereas social distancing, self-isolation, and closure of public spaces reduce k. It is evident that dI/dt will be positive (outbreak) or negative (epidemic contained) depending on the sign of (\u03b2(S/S o ) \u2212 \u03b3), which is one of the main reasons the basic reproduction number is sought.",

In a compartmental model such as the SIR, every individual is susceptible and the average number of susceptibles that encounter an infected individual over a period \u03c4 is simply \u03b2 \u03c4 .

An alternative is to regress di/dt upon i at early times to detect the highest slope, which can then be used to infer R o . This approach is also featured in Figure 1 , which illustrates that the SIR dynamics exhibit rapid deviations from a linear di/dt with i set by early times thereby underestimating R o (for a given \u03b3).

The main advantage is that the early time slope (= R o \u2212 1) persists over much of the graph. A significant decline in di/dt is also required before 'registering' a drop in such a representation. This insensitivity to moderate declines in di/dt from its initial value may be advantageous in R o estimates. The other main limitation, which is inherent to all such analyses, is shifts in testing frequency at high i, and thus the increase in confirmed cases due to expanded testing. It is to be noted that a log-log representation will be more robust to these shifts, because the overall graph will be biased by the initial slope prior to the initialization of expanded testing. Such bias should lead to increases in di/dt versus i, not declines from the initial slope (R o \u22121) that can be detected. As later shown, such an increase has been noted in several data sets.",

For this reason, daily data on infections were smoothed with a 7 day block-average and dI/dt was estimated from the smoothed data. The results show a global convergence to R o = 4.5 from early time-analysis in Figure 2 . Examples for specific countries are also featured in Figure 3 illustrating the same early slope patterns. Mindful of all the pitfalls in determining R o [17] , the global estimate here of R o = 4.5 is roughly commensurate with other entirely independent estimates for COVID-19. The most recent update from the China study suggests an R o = 4.1 [25] whereas for France, the most recent estimate for early times is R o = 4.9 [26] . The initially reported and the much cited R o = 2.2 value [4] from Wuhan, China appears to be low [27] . A more elaborate estimate of R o based on case reports, incubation periods, high-resolution real-time human travel data, infection data combined with agent-based mathematical models result in R o = 4.7\u22126.6 [27] . Other studies report values between 3.3 and 6.6 [28] . It must be emphasized that the R o determined here reflects 'country-scale' early times assuming the entire country population to be S o , \u03b3 = (1/14)d \u22121 and does not accommodate any early measures enacted to reduce \u03b2 or increase \u03b3, which were undertaken in China [13] .",

On a log-log representation, log(di/dt) = m log(i) + log(\u03b2). A constant slope such as those featured in Figures 2 and 3 may simply be estimates of m instead of R o . The initial conjecture is that a power-law solution emerges from the modified SIR dynamics when m < 1. However, the slope here (= 3.5) actually exceeds unity contradicting this revised analysis. This finding supports the view that a global convergence to an uncontrolled R o = 4.5 is a more likely explanation than a power-law alternative arising from a non-linear force of infection in an SIR framework. To be clear, there are other causes for power-law solutions (e.g. a stochastic \u03b2 as discussed elsewhere [31] ), but those fall outside the domain of deterministic SIR approaches adopted here. Nonetheless, and as a bridge between the studies reporting power-law growth in time for I and the modified SIR here, a relation between m and a is sought.

This hypothesis can be implemented in the SIR model considering the temporal dynamics of the testing capacity, f . Assuming the maximum fraction of individuals that can be tested is f = 1 and testing capacity grows at a rate k, independent of I, gives, f (t) = 1 \u2212 exp (kt). Therefore, the apparent number of infections, i a , initially grows according to the superposition of the infectious spread rate and testing capacity increase rate, i.e., exp [(R 0 \u2212 1 + k)t] and log (di a /dt) \u223c (R 0 \u22121+k) log (i a ). Therefore, the log-log slope will be initially greater than (R 0 \u2212 1) while the rate of testing increases and then converge to (R 0 \u2212 1) asymptotically as testing reaches steady-state. Indeed, this effect is widely observed in the global and smaller-scale data, indicating that the imprint of testing ramp-up fully dissipates (at least at the country scale) and the observed convergent slope remains a robust indicator of the early phases of virus dynamics.",

The maximum number of infected I max at time t and cumulative number of infections R(\u221e) \u2248 R(\u03b3t \u2248 14) can be made to vary as the slope k c and t 50 are changed (equation 6). A larger k c signifies more rapid enforcement of intervention policies and a larger t 50 represents later enforcement. To provide a physical meaning for k c , we define t fo as the time after first infection at which R o is f o % of the way through its total decline from R o,u to R o,c . With these definitions, t fo = t 50 + log[f o /(1 \u2212 f o )]/k c . An obvious choice for R o,u = 4.5, the global average when no intervention is enforced. A logical choice for f o = 80% and is consistent with the point at which the logistic function enters the 'flattening phase'. We choose R o,c = 1.0 to represent the most optimistic scenario of a near-containment by intervention. For reference, the South Korea data suggests that early intervention, even when rapidly enforced shortly after the outbreak, resulted in R o = 1.5 [32] . The effectiveness of interventions and any delays can now be converted to mortality and severity by varying t 50 and t 80 on R(\u03b3t \u2248 14) and I max as shown in figure 9 . These figures present how R(\u03b3t \u2248 14), a number connected to the cumulative number of fatalities, and I max , a number representing the degree to which existing resources (i.e., hospital beds will be overwhelmed), are contained for only a restricted envelope of speed and timeliness of policy enforcement. The results in Figure 9 indicate that if R o > 2.7 within t = 3.5/\u03b3 (about 49 d here), a > 10% reductions relative to S o in I max or R(\u221e) are unlikely.",
