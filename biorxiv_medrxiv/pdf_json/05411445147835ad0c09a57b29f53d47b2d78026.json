Despite governmental initiatives aimed at containing the spread of the disease, several countries are experiencing unmanageable increases in the demand for ICU beds, medical equipment, and larger testing capacity. Efficient COVID-19 diagnosis enables healthcare systems to provide better care for patients while protecting caregivers from the disease. However, many countries are constrained by the limited amount of test kits available, the lack of equipment and trained professionals. In the case of patients visiting emergency rooms (ERs) with a suspect of COVID-19, a prompt diagnosis can improve the outcome and even provide information for efficient hospital management. In this context, a quick, inexpensive and readily available test to perform an initial triage at ER could help to smooth patient flow, provide better patient care, and reduce the backlog of exams.",

Probably the most important outcome is related to testing availability, which at this point is extremely low in many countries. Considering the achieved specificity, we would reduce by at least 90% the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests performed at emergency rooms, with the chance of getting a false negative at around 5%. The second important outcome is related to patient management in hospitals. Patients predicted as positive by our framework could be immediately separated from the other patients while waiting for the results of confirmatory tests. This could reduce the spread rate inside hospitals since in many hospitals all suspected cases are kept in the same ward. In Brazil, where the data was collected, rate infection is starting to quickly spread, the lead time of a SARS-CoV-2 can be up to 2 weeks.",

By April 5, 2020, more than 1.2 million people were infected by the new coronavirus, with over 60,000 deaths according to the World Health Organization (WHO) situation report 76 . 1 Efficient COVID-19 diagnosis enables healthcare systems to provide better care to patients while protecting caretakers from the disease. Most tests for the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for COVID-19 may either (i) detect the presence of a virus or a protein, called molecular test, or (ii) detect antibodies produced as a reaction for virus exposure (Li et al., 2020) . Tests of type (i) are usually related to Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) which is labor-intensive in terms of laboratory procedures (Corman et al., 2020) . Tests of type (ii) usually detect the IgG and IgM immunoglobulins related to SARS-CoV-2 and can be commercialized in the form of rapid tests (Li et al., 2020) . However, the global clinical industry is currently incapable of meeting such demand. For instance, in Brazil, with a population of more than 200 million people, according to the Health Ministry , the country 2 received at the end of March/2020 only 500,000 rapid tests.",

Before training our model, C reactive protein missing values (99 out of 599) were imputed using the kNN algorithm (Torgo, 2016) (k=5). Support Vector Machines (SVM) are an AI technique that can be used for classification (i.e. given a sample, predict if that sample is \"positive\" or \"negative\"). This algorithm has been successfully used in many biomedical applications and tends to present good performance. However, due to the small number of \"positive\" samples in the dataset (13.52%), the algorithm is prone to favor the majority class, that is, predicting all samples as \"negative\", resulting in extremely low sensitivity. Oversampling and ensemble methods were applied to mitigate against this problem. SMOTE ( The boosting algorithm identifies the incorrect predictions and assigns a larger weight for that sample, such that at the next iteration the algorithm will pay more attention to it. SMOTEBoost combines both approaches to improve classification performance for the smaller class.",

            "text": "A limitation of our study is that we were not capable of identifying with high certainty which blood exams contribute the most to the classification due to the nature of our AI model framework. However, previous studies already identified that C reactive protein (Ling, 2020) , leukocytes (Cheng et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2020) , platelets (Cheng et al., 2020) , and lymphocytes (Xu et al., 2020) are altered at different levels in COVID-19 patients. Thus, we envision for future research a detailed study of which blood exams are more informative for differential diagnosis, as well as for understanding how the SARS-CoV-2 virus alters blood components.",
