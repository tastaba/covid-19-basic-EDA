We analyzed more than 100 millions Twitter messages posted worldwide in 64 languages during the epidemic emergency due to SARS-CoV-2 and classified the reliability of news diffused. We found that waves of unreliable and low-quality information anticipate the epidemic ones, exposing entire countries to irrational social behavior and serious threats for public health. When the epidemics hit the same area, reliable information is quickly inoculated, like antibodies, and the system shifts focus towards certified informational sources. Contrary to mainstream beliefs, we show that human response to falsehood exhibits early-warning signals that might be mitigated with adequate communication strategies.",

Although the level of complexity of past human societies has been often underestimated, it can be claimed that, in the past few decades, the acceleration of globalization processes has brought about an unprecedented level of large-scale interdependencies, from trade of goods to communications, that dramatically changed the temporal scales of shock propagation. However, how to map and understand the potential diffusion pathways which might lead to major systemic crises or even collapse is still unknown.",

One would therefore expect that the human propensity to cooperate would be further magnified when facing major threats that put collective wellbeing at risk. In large, complex societies, an important mediator of large-scale cooperation is communication ( 14 ) , which may be crucial to coordinate individual perceptions and behaviors in the pursuit of the common interest ( 15 ) . The recent explosion of publicly shared, decentralized information production that characterizes digital societies ( 16 ) and in particular social media activity ( 17 ) provides an exceptional laboratory for the observation and the study of these complex social dynamics ( 18 ) , and potentially functions as a very powerful resource to enact effective, pro-social cooperation and coordination in large-scale crises ( 19 ) . Global pandemics are certainly an instance of such crises, and the current outbreak of COVID-19 may therefore be thought of as a natural experiment to observe social responses to a major threat that may potentially escalate to catastrophic levels, and has already managed to seriously affect levels of economic activity, and radically alter human social behaviors across the globe.",

Spreading false information or even conspiracy theories that support implausible explanations of the causal forces at work behind the crisis may create serious confusion and even discourage people from taking the crisis seriously or responsibly, all the more so, the more such signals receive social validation and spread across social groups and communities ( 21 ) . Therefore, if on the one hand we face the risks of a global epidemics threat, requiring outstanding efforts for modeling and anticipating the time course of the spreading ( 22 ) , on the other hand we can speak of an infodemics threat ( 23 ) , where low-quality content provides an alternative for news consumption to unclear official communications. The infodemics can be thought, similarly to epidemics, as an outbreak of false rumors and fake news with unexpected effects on social dynamics (see Fig. 1 ). In fact, the dangerousness of infodemics can compare and sum up to a large extent to that of the epidemics itself ( 24 ) .",

However, the exact fundamental mechanisms responsible for the spread of false information and inflammatory content, e.g. during political events ( 5 , 30 ) ( 31 , 32 ) , remains fundamentally unknown.

At the opposite, in a high-risk country such as Venezuela, the infodemics is in full swing throughout the period of observation, and in addition to the expected activity from unverified sources one notices that even verified ones contribute to a large extent to the infodemics.

Here too, information about the epidemics is fragmented and mostly unreliable. Overall, the global level of infodemic risk tends to decrease as the epidemics spread globally, suggesting that evidence of the expansion of the contagion leads people to look for relatively more reliable sources, and that verified influencers with many followers started inoculating the system with more reliable news (see Figures S3 and S4) , playing a role that presents interesting analogies to that of antibodies in the treatment of an infectious disease. This overall pattern is confirmed in terms of measures of Infodemic Risk aggregated daily and at country level ( Fig. 3 and Fig. S5 ). The effect is particularly pronounced with the escalation of the epidemics, suggesting that this effect could be mediated by levels of perceived social alarm. It is also interesting to observe though that countries with high infodemic risk might also be more unreliable in terms of reporting of epidemic data, thus altering the perceptions of people and indirectly misleading them in their search for reliable information.",

Perceived and actual biological and social risks feed upon one another, and may co-evolve in complex ways. Especially in situations where effective therapies to contrast the diffusion of the pandemic are not readily available, coordination of behaviors and diffusion of pro-social orientations driven by reliable information at all scales are the key resources for the mitigation of adverse effects.

            "text": "We have followed a consolidated strategy for collecting social media data. We focused on Twitter, which is well-known for providing access to publicly available messages upon specific requests through their application programming interface (API). We have identified a set of hashtags and keywords gaining special collective attention, namely: coronavirus, ncov, #Wuhan, covid19, covid-19, sarscov2, covid . This set includes the official name of the virus and the disease, including the preliminary ones, as well as the name of the city of the first epidemic outbreak. We have used the Filter API -to collect the data in real time from 24 Jan 2020 to 10 Mar 2020 -and of the Search API -to collect the data between 21 Jan 2020 and 24 Jan 2020. Our choice allowed us to monitor, without interruptions and regardless of the language, all the tweets posted about COVID19 since when China reported more than 6,000 cases (20 Jan 2020), calling for the attention of the international community. The Stream API has the advantage of providing all the messages satisfying our selection criteria and posted to the platform in the period of observation, provided that their volume is not larger than 1% of the overall -unfiltered -volume of posted messages. Above 1% of the overall flow of information, the Filter API provides a sample of filtered tweets and communicates an estimate of the amount of lost messages. Note that this choice is the safest as to date: in fact, it has been recently shown that biases affecting Sample API (which samples data based on rate limits), for instance, are not found in REST and Filter APIs ( 35 ) . We estimate that until 24 Feb 2020 we lost about 60,000 tweets out of millions, capturing more than 99.5% of all messages posted (see Fig. S1 ). The global attention towards COVID19 increased the volume of messages after 25 Feb 2020: however, Twitter restrictions allowed us to get no more than 4.5 millions messages per day, on average. We have estimated a total of 161.2 millions tweets posted until 10 Mar 2020: we have successfully collected 112.6 millions of them, providing an unprecedented opportunity for infodemics analysis.",

As a general principle, the more systematic and intentionally harmful the knowledge manipulation and data fabrication, the higher the Harm Score (HS). Scientific content has the lowest level of HS due to the rigorous process of validation carried out through scientific methods. Mainstream media content has the second lowest level of HS due to its constant scrutiny in terms of fact checking and media accountability. Satire is an unreliable source of news but due to its explicit goal of distorting or mis-representing information according to the specific cultural codes of humor and social critique, is generally identified with ease as an unreliable source. Clickbait is a more dangerous source (and thus ranking higher in HS) due to its intent to pass fabricated or mis-represented information and facts for true, with the main purpose of attracting attention and online traffic, that is, for mostly commercial purposes, but without a clear ideological intent. Other is a general purpose category that contains diverse forms of (possibly) misleading or fabricated content, not easily classifiable but likely including bits of ideologically structured content pursuing systematic goals of social manipulation, and thus ranking higher in HS. Shadow is a similar category to the previous one, where in addition links are anonymized and often temporary, thereby adding an extra element of unaccountability and manipulation that translates into a higher level of HS. Political is a category where we find an ample spectrum of content with varying levels of distortion and manipulation of information, also including mere selective reporting and omission, whose goal is that of building consensus for a political position against others, and therefore directly aiming at polluting the public discourse and opinion making, with a comparatively higher level of HS with respect to the previous categories. Fake/hoax contains entirely manipulated or fabricated inflammatory content which is intended to be perceived as realistic and reliable and whose goal may also be political, but fails to meet the basic rules of plausibility and accountability, thus reaching a even higher level of HS. Finally, the highest level of HS is associated to conspiracy/junk science , that is, to strongly ideological, inflammatory content that aims at building conceptual paradigms that are entirely alternative and oppositional to tested and accountable knowledge and information, with the intent of building self-referential bubbles where fidelized audiences are simply refusing a priori any kind of knowledge or information that is not legitimized by the alternative source itself or by recognized affiliates, as it is typical in sects of religious or other nature.",

The difference, possibly caused by the correlation of this kind of behaviour with the choice of how customising the field \"location\" of one's profile, corresponds to a slight overestimate for unverified accounts and an underestimate of the fraction of fake news for verified profiles.

We first compute the average value for days with no confirmed cases, which is 0.276 (blue line in figure) . We then aggregate all days with confirmed cases in homogeneous bins and compute the average values (red points). We observe that reporting of the first case is associated with a drop in the risk index, followed by an increase back to the \"natural level\" in correspondence of 3 confirmed cases.
