To analyze SARS-CoV-2 (reference Wuhan strain MN908947), we employed CROSS 11 that 101 protein (nucleotides 26523-27191), spike S protein (nucleotides 23000-24000), and nucleocapsid N 104 protein (nucleotides 2874-29533; Fig. 1 ) 24 . The lowest density of double-stranded regions were 105 observed at nucleotides 6000-6250 and 20000-21500 and correspond to the regions between the 106 non-structural proteins nsp14 and nsp15 and the upstream region of the spike surface protein S (Fig.  107 1) 24 . In addition to the maximum corresponding to nucleotides 23000-24000, the structural content 108 of spike S protein shows minima at around nucleotides 20500 and 24500 (Fig. 1) . 109 We used the Vienna method 25 to further investigate the RNA secondary structure of specific 110 regions identified with CROSS 12 . Employing a 100 nucleotide window centered around CROSS 111 maxima and minima, we found good match between CROSS scores and Vienna free energies (Fig.  112   1) . Strong agreement is also observed between CROSS and Vienna positional entropy, indicating 113 that regions with the highest structural content have also the lowest structural diversity. 114 115 Our analysis suggests presence of structural elements in SARS-CoV-2 that have evolved to interact 116 with specific human proteins 10 . Our observation is based on the assumption that structured regions 117 have an intrinsic propensity to recruit proteins 13 , which is supported by the fact that structured 118 transcripts act as scaffolds for protein assembly 14, 15 . In this analysis, we compared the Wuhan strain MN908947 with around 2800 other coronaviruses 128 (data from NCBI) having as host human (Fig. 2) or other species (Supp. Fig. 1) . When comparing 129 SARS-CoV-2 with human coronaviruses (1387 strains, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV), we 130 found that the most conserved region falls inside the spike S genomic locus (Fig. 2) coding regions with several minima in correspondence to areas between genes (Fig. 3A) . One 152 highly conserved region is between nucleotides 23000 -24000 in the spike S genomic locus, while 153 sequences up-and down-stream are variable (Fig. 3A) . We then used CROSSalign 12 to compare 154 the structural content (Materials and Methods). High variability of structure is observed for both 155 the 5' and 3' and for nucleotides between 21000 -22000 as well as 24000 -25000, associated with 156 the S region (red bars in Fig. 3A) . The rest of the regions are significantly conserved at a structural 157 level (p-value < 0.0001; Fisher's test). 158",

Following a protocol to study structural 181 conservation in viruses 12 , we first divided the Wuhan sequence in 30 fragments of 1000 nucleotides 182 each moving from the 5' to 3' and then calculated the protein-RNA interactions of each fragment 183 with catRAPID omics (3340 canonical and non-canonical RNA-binding proteins, or RBPs, for a 184 total 102000 interactions) 16 . Proteins such as PTBP1 showed the highest interaction propensity (or 185 Z-score; Materials and Methods) at the 5' while others such as HNRNPQ showed the highest 186 interaction propensity at the 3', in agreement with previous studies on coronaviruses 32 . 187",

Fragment 1 corresponds to the 5' and is the most 192 contacted by RBPs (around 120 with Z\u22652 high-confidence interactions; Fig. 4A ), which is in 193 agreement with the observation that highly structured regions attract a large number of proteins 13 . 194 Indeed, the 5' contains a leader sequence and the untranslated region with multiple stem loop 195 structures that control RNA replication and transcription 33,34 . 196 197 The interactome of each fragment was then analysed using cleverGO, a tool for GO enrichment 198 analysis 35 .

To investigate the interactions potential of SARS-CoV-2 RNA with human 77 proteins, we employed catRAPID 16,17 . catRAPID 18 estimates the binding potential of protein and 78 RNA molecules through van der Waals, hydrogen bonding and secondary structure propensities of 79 allowing identification of interaction partners with high confidence 19 . The unbiased analysis of 80 more than 100000 protein interactions with SARS-CoV-2 RNA reveals that the 5' of SARS-CoV-81 2 has strong propensity to bind to human proteins involved in viral infection and especially reported 82 to be associated with HIV infection. A comparison between SARS-CoV and HIV reveals indeed 83 similarities 20 , but the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and HIV is still unexplored. 84 Interestingly, HIV and SARS-CoV-2, but not SARS-CoV nor MERS-CoV, have a furin-cleavage 85 site occurs in the spike S protein, which could explain the spread velocity of SARS-CoV-2 86 compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 21,22 . Yet, many processes related to SARS-CoV-2 87replication are unknown and our study aims to suggest relevant protein interactions for that our large-scale calculations of structural properties and binding partners of SARS-91CoV-2 will be useful to identify the mechanisms of virus replication within the human host.",

            "text": "we found proteins related to defence response to viruses, such as ATP-dependent RNA 211 helicase DDX1 (Q92499), are involved in the negative regulation of viral genome replication. Some 212 proteins are listed as DNA binding proteins such as Cyclin-T1 CCNT1 (Uniprot code O60563 36 ), 213 Zinc finger protein 175 ZNF175 (Q9Y473), while Prospero homeobox protein 1 PROX1 (Q92786) 214were included because they could have potential RNA-binding ability(Fig. 4D)37  . As for fragment 215 2, we found two canonical RBPs: E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase TRIM32 (Q13049) and E3 ubiquitin-216 protein ligase TRIM21 (P19474), which are listed as negative regulators of viral release from host 217 cell, negative regulators of viral transcription and positive regulators of viral entry into host cells. 218Finally, for fragment 29, 10 of the 11 viral proteins found are members of the Gag polyprotein 219 family, that perform different tasks during HIV assembly, budding, maturation. More than a simple 220 scaffold protein forming the viral core, Gag proteins are recognized as elements able to select viral 221 and host proteins as they traffic to the cell membrane (Supp.Table 1) 38 . 222 223 Analysis of functional annotations carried out with GeneMania 39 reveals that proteins interacting 224 with the 5' of SARS-CoV-2 RNA are associated with regulatory pathways involving NOTCH2, 225 MYC and MAX that have been previously connected to viral infection processes (Fig. 4B) 40,41 . 226 Interestingly, some of the proteins, including DDX1, ZNF175 and CCNT1 for fragment 1 and 227 TRIM32 for fragment 2, are reported to be necessary for HIV functions and replication inside the 228 cell. The roles of these proteins in the replication of a retrovirus such as HIV are expected to be 229 different from those associated with SARS-CoV-2, yet it has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 230 represses host gene expression through a number of unknown mechanisms, which could also 231 involve sequestration of transcriptional elements such as Cyclin-T1 CCNT1 42 . DDX1 is required 232 for HIV-1 Rev function as well as for HIV-1 and coronavirus IBV replication and it binds to the 233 RRE sequence of HIV-1 RNAs 43,44 . ZNF175 is relatively uncharacterized reported to interfere with 234 HIV-1 replication by suppressing Tat-induced viral LTR promoter activity 45 . Finally, CCNT1 is 235 7SK snRNA binding and regulates transactivation domain of the viral nuclear transcriptional 236 activator, Tat 46,47 . In addition, TRIM32 (fragment 2) is a well-defined Tat binding protein and, 237 EIAV Tat proteins in vivo 48 . 239 240 Analysis of interactions with SARS-CoV-2 Open Reading Frames identifies additional 241 interactions involved in HIV infection 242 243 Recently, Gordon et al. reported a list of human proteins binding to Open Reading Frames (ORFs) 244 translated from SARS-CoV-2 49 . Identified through affinity purification followed by mass 245 spectrometry quantification, 332 proteins from HEK-293T cells interact with viral ORF peptides. 246 By selecting 274 proteins binding at the 5' with Z score \u22651.5 (Supp. Table 1), of which 140 are 247 exclusively interacting with fragment 1 (Fig. 4B), we found that 8 are also reported in the list by 248 Gordon et al. 49 , which indicates significant enrichment (representation factor of 2.5; p-value of 249 0.02; hypergeometric test with human proteome in background). The fact that our list of protein-250 RNA binding partners contains elements identified also in the protein-protein network analysis is 251 not surprising, as ribonucleoprotein complexes evolve together 13 and their components sustain each 252 other activities through different types of interactions 15 . 253 254 We note that out of 332 interactions, 60 are RBPs (as reported in Uniprot 36 ), which represents a 255 considerable fraction (20%), considering that there are around 1500 RBPs in the human proteome 256 (6%) and fully justified by the fact that they involve association with viral RNAs. Comparing the 257 RBPs present in Gordon et al. 49 and those present in our list (79 as reported in Uniprot), we found 258 an overlap of 6 proteins (representation factor = 26.5; p-value < 10 -8 ; hypergeometric test), 259 including: Janus kinase and microtubule-interacting protein 1 JAKMIP1 (Q96N16), A-kinase 260 anchor protein 8 AKAP8 (O43823) and A-kinase anchor protein 8-like AKAP8L (Q9ULX6), 261which in case of HIV-1 infection is involved as a DEAD/H-box RNA helicase binding 50 , signal 262 recognition particle subunit SRP72 (O76094), binding to the 7S RNA in presence of SRP68, La-263 related protein 7, LARP7 (Q4G0J3) and La-related protein 4B LARP4B (Q92615), which are part 264 of a system for transcriptional regulation acting by means of the 7SK RNP system 51 (Fig. 4E; 265Supp.",

The regions containing the highest amount of structure 317 are the 5' as well as glycoproteins spike S and membrane M. 318319We found that the spike S protein domain encompassing amino acids 330-500 is highly conserved 320 across SARS-CoV-2 strains. This result suggests that spike S must have evolved to specifically 321 interact with its host partner ACE2 27 and mutations increasing the binding affinity are highly 322 infrequent. As the nucleic acids encoding for this region are enriched in double-stranded content, 323 we speculate that the structure might attract host regulatory elements, which further constrains its 324 variability. The fact that the ACE2 receptor binding site is conserved among the SARS-CoV-2 325 strains suggests that a specific drug can be designed to prevent host interaction and thus infection,326 which could work for a large number of coronaviruses. 327 328 By contrast, the highly variable region at amino acids 243-302 in spike S protein corresponds to the 329 binding site of sialic acids in MERS-CoV (see manuscript by E. Milanetti et al. \"In-Silico evidence 330 for two receptors based strategy of SARS-CoV-2\" ) 7,9,31 and could play a role in infection 30 . The 331 fact that the binding region changes in the different strains might indicate a variety of binding 332 affinities for sialic acids, which could provide clues on the specific responses in the human 333 population. Interestingly, the sialic acid binding site is absent in SARS-CoV but present in MERS-334CoV, which indicates that it must have evolved recently. 335 336 Both our sequence and structural analyses of spike S protein indicate that human engineering of 337 SARS-CoV-2 is highly unlikely. 338 339 author/funder.
