In an unprecedented collective e\u21b5ort, massive amounts of data are now being collected worldwide to estimate the immediate and long-term impact of this pandemic on the health system and the global economy. However, the precise timeline of the disease, its transmissibility, and the e\u21b5ect of mitigation strategies remain incompletely understood. Here we integrate a global network model with a local epidemic SEIR model to quantify the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 in China and the United States. For the outbreak in China, in n = 30 provinces, we found a latent period of 2.56\u00b10.72 days, a contact period of 1.47\u00b10.32 days, and an infectious period of 17.82\u00b12.95 days. We assume that the latent and infectious periods are disease-specific and the contact period is behaviorspecific and can vary between di\u21b5erent communities, states, or countries. For the early stages of the outbreak in the United States, in n = 50 states, we adopted the latent and infectious periods from China, and found a contact period of 3.38\u00b10.69 days. With no additional mitigation strategies, our epidemic network model predicts a basic reproduction number of 5.3\u00b10.95 and a nationwide peak of the outbreak on May 10, 2020 with 3 million infections across the United States. Our results demonstrate how mathematical modeling can help estimate outbreak dynamics and provide decision guidelines for mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic. We anticipate that our model will become a valuable tool to estimate the potential of vaccination and quantify the e\u21b5ect of relaxing political measures including total lock down, shelter in place, and travel restrictions for lowrisk subgroups of the population or for the population as a whole.",

            "text": "In December 2019, a local outbreak of pneumonia of initially unknown cause was detected in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in central China [24] . The cause of the disease was identified as the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2 [16] . Infection with the virus can be asymptomatic or can result in a mild to severe symptomatic disease, coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19. The majority of COVID-19 cases result in mild symptoms including fever, cough, shortness of breath, and respiratory distress [20] . Severe complications arise when the disease progresses to viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure. The SARS-CoV-2 virus can spread quickly, mainly during close contact, but also through small droplets from coughing or sneezing [32] . After the first four cases were reported on December 29, the outbreak quickly spread from Wuhan across all provinces of mainland China, and, in the following two months, across the entire world. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization acknowledged the alarming levels of spread and severity, and characterized the COVID-19 situation as a pandemic [31] . As of today, April 4, 2020, COVID-19 has a\u21b5ected At day 0, a fraction of the susceptible population is exposed to the virus. At day 3, exposed individuals become infectious, and the infectious period lasts for 10 days. At day 5, infectious individuals become symptomatic; the majority of the symptomatic population recovers after 9 days. At day 9, a fraction of the symptomatic population is hospitalized; the majority of the hospitalized population recovers after 14 days. At day 10, a fraction of the hospitalized population experiences critical conditions that last for 10 days and end in either recovery or in death. On the population level, the outbreak of COVID-19 can be summarized in eight curves that illustrate the dynamics of the individual subgroups.",

Figure 1 illustrates a typical timeline of COVID-19 in a single person and shows how this timeline maps onto an entire population. For this example [17] , at day 0, a number of susceptible individuals are exposed to the virus and transition from the susceptible to the exposed state. Around at day 3, the exposed individuals become infectious. During this time, they can infect others, while not showing any symptoms themselves. The infectious period lasts for approximately 10 days. Around day 5, infectious individuals become symptomatic. This implies that they have potentially spread the disease for two days without knowing it. In the majority of (1 \u232b h ) of the population, the symptomatic period lasts for approximately 9 days. Around day 9, a severely a\u21b5ected population of \u232b h are hospitalized and their hospitalization lasts for approximately 14 days.

            "text": "The first mathematical models for infectious diseases date back to a smallpox model by Daniel Bernoulli in 1760 [4] . Since the 1920s, compartment models have become the most common approach to model the epidemiology of infectious diseases [21] . One of the simplest compartment models is the SEIR model that represents the timeline of a disease through four compartments, the susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered populations [2] . The temporal evolution of these compartments is governed by a set of ordinary di\u21b5erential equations parameterized in terms of the transition rates between them [18] . The transition rates \u21b5 from the exposed to the infectious state and from the infectious to the recovered state are disease specific parameters. In fact, they are the inverses of the latent period A = 1/\u21b5, the time during which an individual is exposed but not yet infectious, and the infectious period C = 1/ , the time during which an individual can infect others. This suggests that these two parameters are relatively independent of country, region, or city. In the example of Figure 1 , the latent and infectious periods are A = 3 days and C = 10 days [17] . The most critical feature of the model is the transition from the susceptible to the exposed state. This transition is typically assumed to scale with the susceptible population S, the infectious population I, and the contact rate , the inverse of the contact period B = 1/ , between them [23] .",

            "text": "The product of the contact rate and the infectious period defines the basic reproduction number, R 0 = C = C/B, the number of individuals that are infected by a single one individual in an otherwise uninfected, susceptible population [11] . The basic reproduction number is a measure of the contagiousness or transmissibility of an infectious agent and it can vary considerably between di\u21b5erent infectious diseases [10] . Typical basic reproduction numbers are on the order of 18 for measles, 9 for chickenpox, 7 for mumps, 7 for rubella, and 5 for poliomyelitis [1] . When the basic basic reproduction number is larger than one, R 0 > 1.0, the infectious period C is larger than the contact period B [23] . This implies that at onset of an epidemic outbreak, when the entire population is susceptible, an infected individual will infect more than one other individual. In agreement with Figure 1 , the infectious population first increases, then reaches a peak, and decreases toward zero [21] . As more and more individuals transition from the susceptible through the exposed and infectious states into the recovered state, the susceptible populations decreases. Once a large enough fraction of a population has become immune-either through recovery from the infection or through vaccination-this group provides a measure of protection for the susceptible population and the epidemic dies out [11] . This indirect protection is called herd immunity [14] . The concept of herd immunity implies that the converged susceptible population at endemic equilibrium is always larger than zero, S 1 > 0, and its value depends on the basic reproduction number R 0 . For a given basic reproduction number R 0 , herd immunity occurs at an immune fraction of (1 1/R 0 ). Knowing the basic reproduction number is therefore critical to estimate the immune fraction of the population that is required to eradicate an infectious disease, for example, 94.4% for measles and 80.0% for poliomyelitis [18] .",

Especially during the early stages of an outbreak, passenger air travel can play a critical role in spreading a disease [3] , since traveling individuals naturally have a disproportionally high contact rate [30] . Border control can play a pivotal role in mitigating epidemics and prevent the spreading between cities, states, or countries [34] . In an attempt to mitigate the COVID-19 outbreak, many countries have implemented travel restrictions and mandatory quarantines, closed borders, and prohibited non-citizens from entry. This has stimulated an ongoing debate about how strong these restrictions should be and when it would be safe to lift them. The basic reproduction number is R 0 provides guidelines about the required strength of political counter measures [18] . However, empirically finding the basic reproduction number requires careful contact tracing and is a lot of work, especially once the number of infectious individuals has grown beyond an overseeable size [24] . Network modeling of travel-induced spreading can play an important role in estimating the value of R 0 [7] and interpreting the impact of travel restrictions and boarder control [19] .",

The COVID-19 outbreak data of the Chinese provinces capture all three phases, increase, peak, and decrease of the infectious population and are currently the richest dataset available to date. This dataset describes the temporal evolution of confirmed, recovered, active, and death cases starting January 22, 2020 [9] . As of April 4, there were 81,639 confirmed cases, 76,755 recovered, 1,558 active, and 3,326 deaths. From these data, we map out the temporal evolution of the infectious group I as the di\u21b5erence between the confirmed cases minus the recovered and deaths, and the recovered group R as the sum of the recovered and deaths in each Chinese province. To simulate the province-specific epidemiology of COVID19 with the SEIR model, we use these data to identify the latent period A = 1/\u21b5, the infectious period C = 1/ , and the contact period B = 1/ as a direct measure of the basic reproduction number R 0 = B/C. As our sensitivity analysis in Figure 3 shows, the dynamics of the SEIR model depend critically on the initial conditions, the number of susceptible S 0 , exposed E 0 , infectious I 0 , and recovered R 0 individuals on the day the very first infectious case is reported, I 0 1. Naturally, on this day, the recovered population is R 0 = 0. Since the exposed population is asymptomatic, its initial value E 0 is unknown. To quantify the initial exposed population E 0 , we introduce a parameter \u21e2 = E 0 /I 0 , the initial latent population [27] . It defines the fraction of exposed versus infectious individuals at day 0 and is a measure of initial hidden community spreading. The fraction of the initial susceptible population, S 0 = 1 E 0 I 0 R 0 , ensures that the total population sums up to one. To map the total population of one onto the absolute number of cases for each province, we introduce the normalization parameter \u2318 = N \u21e4 /N , the a\u21b5ected population. It defines the fraction of the province-specific epidemic subpopulation N \u21e4 relative to the province population N [29] . Altogether we identify five parameters for each province, the exposed period A = 1/\u21b5, the infectious period C = 1/ , the contact period B = 1/ or the basic reproduction number R = C/B, the initial latent population \u21e2 = E 0 /I 0 , and the a\u21b5ected population \u2318 = N \u21e4 /N . We performed the parameter identification using the Levenberg-Marquardt method of least squares. In this identification process, we ignored data from secondary outbreaks [9] .",

            "text": "The dynamics of the SEIR model are determined by three parameters, the latent period A = 1/\u21b5, and the infectious period C = 1/ , and the contact period Increasing the latent period increases the exposed population and decreases the infectious population. The susceptible and recovered populations converge to the same endemic equilibrium at S 1 = 0.202 and R 1 = 0.798, however, slower. The steepest susceptible, infectious, and recovery curves correspond to the SIR model without separate exposed population with A = 0 days with the maximum infectious population of I max = 0.157 after 86 days. Latent period A = 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 days, infectious period C = 20 days, basic reproduction number R 0 = C/B = 2.0, and initial exposed fraction E 0 = 0.010. B = 1/ , or, alternatively, the basic reproduction number R 0 = C/B. Before identifying these parameters for the outbreaks in China and in the United States, we will illustrate their e\u21b5ects by systematically varying each parameter while keeping the other values fixed. Specifically, unless stated otherwise, we choose a latent period of A = 5 days, an infectious period of C = 20 days, a basic reproduction number of R 0 = C/B = 2.0, and an initial exposed population E 0 = 0.010. Figure 3 illustrates the sensitivity of the SEIR model with respect to the size of the initial exposed population E 0 . Decreasing the initial exposed population from E 0 = 10 2 , 10 3 , 10 4 , 10 5 , 10 6 , 10 7 , 10 8 delays the onset of the outbreak while the dynamics of the susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered populations remain the same. For all seven cases, the susceptible and recovered populations converge to the same endemic equilibrium with S 1 = 0.202 and R 1 = 0.798. The infectious population increases gradually, reaches its maximum at I max = 0.121, and then decreases. For the largest initial exposed population of E 0 = 0.01 this maximum occurs after 125 days. Decreasing the initial exposed population by a factor 10 delays the maximum by 65 days. This highlights the exponential nature of the model, which causes a constant delay for a logarithmic decrease of the exponential population, while the overall outbreak dynamics remain the same. In view of the COVID-19 outbreak, this supports the general notion that even a single individual can cause an outbreak. If multiple individuals trigger the outbreak in a province, state, or country, the overall outbreak dynamics will remain the same, but the peak of the outbreak will happen earlier. Figure 4 illustrates the sensitivity of the SEIR model with respect to the latent period A. Increasing the latent period from A = 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 days increases the exposed population and decreases the infectious population. The susceptible and recovered populations converge to the same endemic equilibrium at S 1 = 0.202 and R 1 = 0.798. Convergence is slower for increased latent periods A. The steepest susceptible, infectious, and recovery curves correspond to the SIR model with A = 0 days. This model does not have a separate exposed population. It reaches its peak infectious population of I max = 0.157 after 86 days. In view of the COVID-19 outbreak this implies that knowledge of the latent period is important to correctly estimate the timing and peak of the infectious population, which ultimately determines the absolute number of hospital beds and ventilator units required to insure appropriate medical care. Figure 5 illustrates the sensitivity of the SEIR model with respect to the infectious period C. Increasing the infectious period at a constant basic reproduction number flattens the exposed population and increases the infectious population. The susceptible and recovered populations converge to the same endemic equilibrium at S 1 = 0.202 and R 1 = 0.798, however, slower. The flattest susceptible, infectious, and recovery curves correspond to longest infectious period of C = 30 days and a contact period of B = 15 days with the maximum infectious population of I max = 0.135 after 169 days. In view of the COVID-19 outbreak, knowing the infectious time is important to correctly estimate the timing and peak of the infectious population, and with it the number of required hospital beds and ventilator units. Figure 6 illustrates the sensitivity of the SEIR model with respect to the basic reproduction number R 0 . Decreasing the basic reproduction number decreases the exposed and infectious populations. The susceptible and recovered populations converge to larger and smaller endemic equilibrium values, and converges is slower. The steepest susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovery curves correspond to the largest basic reproduction number of R 0 = 10.0 with the maximum infectious population of I max = 0.488 after 35 days and converge to an endemic equilibrium at S 1 = 0.0001 and R 1 = 0.9999. In view of the COVID-19 outbreak, the basic reproduction number is the parameter that we can influence by political counter measures. Reduc-.

While the latent period A and the infectious period C are disease specific, community mitigation and political action can modulate the basic reproduction number R 0 through a variety of measures including active contact tracing, isolation of infectious individuals, quarantine of close contacts, travel restrictions, physical distancing, or total lock down. Figure 7 illustrates the e\u21b5ect of the basic reproduction number R 0 on the maximum exposed and infectious populations E max and I max and on the converged susceptible and recovered populations S 1 and R 1 at endemic equilibrium. Increasing the basic reproduction number beyond one increases the maximum exposed and infectious populations. The converged susceptible and recovered populations decrease towards zero and increase towards one. For the chosen latent and infectious periods of A = 5 days and C = 20 days, the time For example, if we we have access to a certain number of intensive care unit beds and ventilators, and we know rates of the infectious population that have to be hospitalized and require intensive care, we need to limit the maximum size of the population that becomes infectious. To limit the infectious fraction to 20% of the total population, i.e., I max = 0.200, we would have to reduce the basic reproduction number to R 0 = 2.69. The gray line indicates that this maximum would occur after 0.25 years or 93 days. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",

The recovered population converges to progressively smaller endemic equilibrium values R 1 =0.798, 0.775, 0.752, 0.726, 0.710, 0,691, 0.669, 0.642. Convergens is slower under constrained outbreak. The lowest exposed and infectious curves and the flattest susceptible and recovery curves correspond to the most constrained infectious population of I tol = 0.02 with a required level of containment of R 0 (t)/R 0 = 0.524. The highest exposed and infectious curves and the steepest susceptible and recovery curves correspond to an unconstrained infectious population I tol = 0.150 > I max = 0.121 with peak infection after 125 days. In view of the COVID-19 outbreak, the gray line tells us how drastic political counter measures need to be. A required level of containment of R 0 (t)/R 0 = 0.524 implies that we need to reduce the number of infections of a single individual by about one half. However, reducing the maximum infectious population comes at a socioeconomic price: The graphs teach us that it is possible to reach an endemic equilibrium at a smaller total number of individuals that have had the disease; yet, this endemic equilibrium would occur much later in time, for this example, after two or three years. Figure 9 summarizes the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak in 30 Chinese provinces. The dots indicate the reported infectious and recovered populations, the lines highlight the simulated susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered populations. The simulations are based on a province-specific parameter identification of the latent period A, the contact period B, the infectious period C, and from both, the basic reproduction number R 0 = C/B, the fraction of the initial latent population \u21e2 = E 0 /I 0 , and the fraction of the a\u21b5ected population \u2318 = N \u21e4 /N for each province. These five province-specific values are reported in each graph. Notably, the province of Hubei, where the outbreak started, has seen the most significant impact with more than 60,000 cases. Naturally, in Hubei, where the first cases were reported, the fraction of the initial latent population \u21e2 is zero. Small values of \u21e2 indicate a close monitoring of the COVID-19 outbreak, with very few undetected cases at the reporting of the first infectious case. The largest value of \u21e2 = 26.4 suggests that, at the onset of the outbreak, a relatively number of cases in the province of Shandong was undetected. The fraction of the a\u21b5ected population \u2318 = N \u21e4 /N is a province-specific measure for the containment of the outbreak. Naturally, this number is largest in the province of Hubei, with \u2318 = 1.3 \u00b7 10 3 , and, because of strict containment, much smaller in all other provinces. Figure 10 shows the dynamics of the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in the 50 states of the United States, the District of Columbia, and the territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. The dots indicate the reported cases and death, the lines highlight the simulated susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered populations. The simulations are based on a state-specific parameter identification of the contact period B that defines the basic reproduction number R 0 = C/B and of the fraction of the initial latent population \u21e2 = E 0 /I 0 at a given outbreak delay d 0 for each state. These three state-specific values are reported in each graph. Since the outbreak is currently still in its early stages, we do not attempt to identify the latent and infectious periods, but rather adopt the mean latent and infectious periods A = 2.56 and C = 17.82 from the Chinese outbreak in Table 1 . Notably, the state of New York is currently seeing the most significant impact with more than 100,000 cases. Naturally, in Washington, Illinois, California, and Arizona where the first cases were reported, the fraction of the initial latent population \u21e2 is small. Largest \u21e2 values occur in New York, New Jersey, Michigan, and Louisiana. The largest basic reproduction numbers R 0 are identified in Idaho, Puerto Rico, Pennsylvania, and Indiana.

These values agree with the reported incubation period of 5.1 days found in 181 confirmed COVID-19 cases outside Wuhan [22] and 5.2 days for the first 425 cases in Wuhan [24] . The total duration from exposure to recovery, (A + C) of our SEIR model, is 20.3 days, 5.3 days shorted than the reported value of 25.6 for the 391 Shenzhen cases [5] . In our model, the reported 4.8 to 5.2 day incubation periods maps onto the latent period A of 2.5 days plus 2.3 to 2.7 days within the infectious period C during which the individuals are infectious but still asymptomatic. This period is critical since individuals can spread the disease without knowing it. The contact tracing study postulates that the infectious period C begins on day 4.8 with the onset of symptoms, 2.3 days later than in our model, and ends on day 7.3 or 9.4 with or without active contract tracing with the beginning of isolation, 13.0 or 10.9 days earlier than in our model. This implies that the infectious period C of our SEIR model is 6.6 and 3.9 times larger .

The basic reproduction number significantly a\u21b5ects the peak of the infectious population both in time and magnitude. The early outbreak data for the infectious populations of all 50 United States in Figure 10 suggest that the contact period is for 3.4 days, resulting in a basic reproduction number of 5.3. For the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the basic reproduction number was estimated to 2.2 [24] and for the 391 cases in Shenzhen, it was 2.6 [5] . A review of the reported basic reproduction numbers for COVID-19 found ranges from 1.40 to 6.49 with a mean of 3.28, values that are larger than those reported for the SARS coronavirus [25] . Huge variations of R 0 values are not uncommon [11] ; even for simple diseases like the measles, reported R 0 value vary between 3.7 and 203.3 [10] . Community mitigation and political action can modulate the basic reproduction number R 0 by a variety of measures including active contact tracing, isolation of infectious individuals, quarantine of close contacts, travel restrictions, physical distancing, or total lock down [13] . Importantly, many of the reported values already include the e\u21b5ect of isolation [24] and active contact tracing and quarantine [5] . If we correct our identified basic reproduction number for China in Figure 9 and Table 1 by reducing our identified infectious period of 17.8 days to the time prior to isolation using the correction factors of 6.6 and 3.9 with and without contact tracing, our R 0 values for China would be 1.91 and 3.23 and fall well within the reported range [25] . Our R 0 value for the United States of 5.30 agrees well with the range of values reported for mathematical model ranging from 1.50 to 6.49 with a mean of 4.20 [25] . Understanding the natural value of R 0 -without any mitigation strategy-is critical to predict the endemic equilibrium, interpret herd immunity, and the estimate the fraction of the population that requires vaccination [18] .",

            "text": "This study proposes a new strategy to characterize the timeline of COVID-19. While this allows us to estimate the peaks of the outbreak in space and time, we need to be aware that this study uses a simple model to characterize a complex infectious disease about which we still know very little to this day. Importantly, we have to be cautious not to overstate the results. Specifically, our study has several limitations: First, our mathematical model does not account for asymptomatic cases. Little is known about the fraction of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals but early studies suggest that up to 25% of individuals have gone from susceptible to recovered without having ever been reported as infectious. Second, the classical SEIR model does not distinguish between asymptomatic infectious in the first days of the disease and symptomatic infectious in the later days. Knowing more about this group and modeling appropriately is critical to accurately estimate the impact of community spreading and mitigation strategies to reduce it. Third, while the initial infectious group I 0 can be reasonably well approximated from the reported active cases and the initial recovered group R 0 is likely zero, the initial exposed group E 0 is really unknown and can hugely e\u21b5ect the outbreak dynamics as the sensitivity study in Figure 3 and the data for China and the United States in Figures 9 and 10 show. We decided to include this e\u21b5ect through the initial latent population \u21e2 to highlight this e\u21b5ect, but more data are needed to better estimate the size of this group. Fourth and probably most importantly, the major variable we can influence through social and political measures is the basic reproduction number R 0 , or rather the interplay of the contact period B and infectious period C. Obviously, we do not know the true R 0 , nor can we measure it at this stage of the outbreak, were every state, province, or country has implemented di\u21b5erent measures to modulate the local outbreak. Yet, this study shows that estimating R 0 is important to illustrate how di\u21b5erent political counter measures work and predict the timeline of the infectious population under current conditions. Finally, our network model only roughly estimates the travel matrix from air travel supplemented by rationalized ground transportation across small neighboring states. A more detailed travel information would allow us to truly simulate travel restrictions and estimate the impact of state-specific travel constraints.",
