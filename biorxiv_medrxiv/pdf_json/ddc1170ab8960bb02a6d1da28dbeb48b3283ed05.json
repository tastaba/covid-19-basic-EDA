There were eight non-specific primers in dozens of primers used in clinical or research detection of COVID-19. Among them, a pair of primer for the ORF1ab regions of SARS-CoV-2 genome, which widely applied to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus in China, well matched some human mRNAs such as Cathepsin C transcripts. Compared to other transcripts, Cathepsin C mRNA had a high abundance in tonsil, lung and small intestine.",

However, there were more than 1 million confirmed coronavirus infections around world. 3 As an easy and rapid method to diagnose coronavirus virus, including SARS-CoV-2, SARS and so on, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was commonly used to confirm COVID-19 infections worldwide. Some institutes or universities provided several RT-PCR assays to diagnose 2019-nCoV (previous name of COVID -19) and the protocols. 4 Because of occurrence of abnormal results, several articles from Chinese research groups had referred to the RT-PCR diagnoses for COVID-19 infections according to China CDC guideline. 5 False-negative RT-PCR test results had been reported by a previous study. 6 Five in 167 patients had presented negative results in first RT-PCR detection for 2019 novel coronavirus with positive chest CT finding. All of them were finally confirmed with COVID-19 infection by second, third or multiple repeated RT-PCR detections. A correspondence on viral load in upper respiratory samples showed that some patients received negative or positive results alternately and repeatedly by using the primers targeted the ORF1ab region of novel coronavirus genome, and similar situation was also described in another correspondence. 7, 8 A recent letter discussed positive RT-PCR test results after two consecutively negative results in four patients recovered from .

However, the WHO reports on new laboratory-confirmed cases and new clinically diagnosed cases in China during the COVID-19 epidemic were helpful to deduce that extent. Rapid raise and drop of total new cases in Figure 1 indicated that the amazing number of clinically diagnosed cases was just an accumulation of those in Hubei province earlier than February 13, 2020. Successive revision in the diagnosis criterion for the novel coronavirus pneumonia in Hubei province had resulted in a sudden surge in the number of total new cases and the removal of clinically diagnosed cases in the province. 16, 17 There was no reports on whether the clinically diagnosed patients tested or not, but it was possible to infer general situation through evaluating the ability to detect COVID-19 infections. The ability to detect COVID-19 infections was steadily enhanced along with the outbreak of the epidemic and then exhibited a great accelerated growth. China National Biotec Group could produce novel coronavirus detection kits for 200,000 people each day on February 18, 2020. 18 In the light of the linear fitting of laboratory-confirmed cases from January 22 to February 5, 2020 in the inset of Figure 1 , the ability to detect COVID-19 infections for more than 14,400 persons besides laboratory-confirmed patients could be deduced from February 6 to February 13, 2020, and that basically met the requirements for 12,289 detections for clinically diagnosed patients on February 13, 2020. Hence it was inferred that a considerable number of clinically diagnosed patients tested and obtained negative results.",
